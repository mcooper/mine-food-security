Famine and Starvation in Africa,{},",class relations;famine;food security","{""african"": 4}","Famine and the crisis of African development have become inseparably linked in popular writing. Visual images of starvation are the icons of African failure, yet they have a dispelling quality accusing everyone and no one. This article reviews recent research on the genesis, dynamics and consequences of famine in Africa. While the entitlement approach to starvation associated with Amartya Sen has proven most helpful it must be situated on the larger political economic canvas by which entitlements and endowments are distributed and fought over - class relations. Food crises must be rooted in what Sen calls the ‘totality of rights’ not entitlements in a narrow legal sense. This provides an important link between famine, food security and democratization in Africa. "

In the last decade alone, the Continent contributed 55% of the world's droughts and 64% of deaths emanating from these disasters. With over 24% of her population affected, Africa accounted for 47% of people affected by droughts in the same period. Given that rain-fed agriculture is a major source of food in most African countries, the droughts have contributed to the acute food-insecurity; this may explain why 35 of the 45 poorest countries are in the Continent. There is consensus that drought early warning systems that contextualize culture and risk, have higher chance of succeeding in reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. A homegrown drought early warning system designed around cheaper wireless sensor weatherboards, mobile phones and weather lore has the ability to address Africa's unique challenges and opportunities. However, integrating these diverse components requires some level of intelligence that only found in multi-agent systems. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive system made up of seven sub-systems that are linked up together by intelligent agents that were implemented using the Java Agent Development. The system's evaluation, carried out in three locations in Africa, revealed the potential of the system. "

The disease is distributed on three continents (Asia, Africa and South America) where it disrupts the food security of people who depend on livestock and animal products. Substantial economic losses are associated with controlling FMD outbreaks in many countries. For example, during the epidemic in the UK in 2001, losses to agriculture were estimated to be £3.1 billion, with similar losses arising from negative impacts on tourism. Over 4 million animals were slaughtered as part of FMD control measures and a further 2 million were slaughtered due to welfare issues associated with animal movement bans. FMD also has a devastating impact on rural livelihoods and livestock trade opportunities in developing countries where it is endemic. In Africa, historic patterns of FMD virus (FMDV) emergence are likely to have been shaped by the introduction and subsequent eradication of rinderpest. However, important questions remain about contemporary drivers of disease distribution. In particular, the relative contribution of wildlife as sources of infection for livestock and factors affecting the potential for cross-species transmission, and mechanisms of viral maintenance in endemic regions are poorly understood. These issues encompass a complex suite of interacting social, ecological and economic factors that act as drivers of change in patterns of land-use, livestock movements, international trade, and conservation of wildlife-protected areas. Understanding patterns of FMDV infection at the livestock-wildlife interface is of particular importance for designing and developing appropriate disease control strategies in sub-Saharan Africa, and of increasing interest as momentum grows for global control of FMD within the framework of the Progressive Control Pathway (PCP-FMD).This chapter reviews the historical distribution and emergence of FMDV in Africa, and factors that govern the current circulation and maintenance of FMDV in sub-Saharan Africa.

Several themes including Academic publishing; inclusion of indigenous knowledge systems in school text books and curriculum; emerging diseases and modern concepts such as HIV/AIDS & climate change; the relevance of the education systems and knowledge application were examined. The study utilized a mixed approach of qualitative and quantitative methods comprising in depth interviews, focus group interviews and site observations in West, East and Southern Africa. The research questions focused on to what extent the current Knowledge was relevant for Africa; who was producing it and to what extent it was being utilized in the Education sector. Knowledge production in Africa is undergoing a renaissance with a shift from the ivory towers to societies and communities and a change in the mode of delivery and teaching methods. Findings revealed that most of the knowledge production and publications were dominated by Western/Northern Publishers and required Modern Technology in the majority of countries. The extent to which African indigenous knowledge was depicted was very low and there was a poor readership culture in South, East and West Africa. Many of the Academic text books reviewed were imported from Europe and were very expensive. The majority of African academics battled to publish due to a variety of reasons ranging from work over load to lack of appropriate Journals in African Universities, among others. The Impacts of globalization on Africa's knowledge production were varied, extensive and had long-term repercussions on the local publishers and young upcoming authors. Recommendations included a revision of the approaches to knowledge production to include Technology, curriculum development and change to incorporate the African indigenous knowledge production; Empowering academic scholarship and authorship; bridging the gap between the school text books and the Scientific Journals and supporting local indigenous publishers in Africa. There is a great need for knowledge production in Africa that takes into account Africa's challenges, local contexts and application. Given the African Renaissance, knowledge production and utilization calls for new ideas, innovation and a new paradigm of inter-, trans-and multi-disciplinary approaches that would integrate integrated application into African solutions"

Humanitarian agencies are trying to mitigate the impact, with limited resources. Data from previous years may help guide decisions. Trends in different populations affected by displacement (1997-2009) were analyzed to investigate: (1) how elevated malnutrition and mortality were among displaced compared to host populations; (2) whether the mortality/malnutrition relation changed through time; and (3) how useful is malnutrition in identifying high mortality situations. Under-five mortality rates (usually from 90-day recall, as deaths/10,000/day: U5MR) and global acute malnutrition (wasting prevalences, < -2SDs of references plus edema: GAM) were extracted from reports of 1,175 surveys carried out between 1997-2009 in the Horn of Africa; these outcome indicators were analyzed by livelihood (pastoral, agricultural) and by displacement status (refugee/internally displaced, local resident/host population, mixed); associations between these indicators were examined, stratifying by status. Patterns of GAM and U5MR plotted over time by country and livelihood clarified trends and showed substantial correspondence. Over the period GAM was steady but U5MR generally fell by nearly half. Average U5MR was similar overall between displaced and local residents. GAM was double on average for pastoralists compared with agriculturalists (17% vs. 8%), but was not different between displaced and local populations. Agricultural populations showed increased U5MR when displaced, in contrast to pastoralist. U5MR rose sharply with increasing GAM, at different GAM thresholds depending on livelihood. Higher GAM cut-points for pastoralists than agriculturalists would better predict elevated U5MR (1/10,000/day) or emergency levels (2/10,000/day) in the Horn of Africa; cut-points of 20-25% GAM in pastoral populations and 10-15% GAM in agriculturalists are suggested. The GAM cut-points in current use do not vary by livelihood, and this needs to be changed, tailoring cut points to livelihood groups, to better identify priorities for intervention. This could help to prioritize limited resources in the current situation of food insecurity and save lives. "

The Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (GDARD) provides basic infrastructure to resource poor farmers, while ARC-VOPI is responsible for applied research and information dissemination. The research programme is designed to develop new methodology aimed at optimization of cultivation practices. Information dissemination efforts include tailor made training courses to improve the skills of hydroponic vegetable growers. ARC-VOPI utilizes two hydroponic systems, i.e., gravel-flow technique (GFT - closed system) and an open-bag system (OBS) for research and technology development. The research programme focuses on plant manipulation, including plant spacing, fruit and stem pruning, fertigation, cultivar evaluation and comparative performance of vegetables in different production systems. Recent research results in GFT revealed that optimization of plant density and harvest methodology resulted in more than double the yield of leafy vegetables with an additional advantage of a shorter growth season and improved quality. A nutrient solution (EC) concentration of 2 dS/m resulted in optimal yield and quality of leafy lettuce during four different growing seasons. Tomatoes produced in a GFT under a shade net structure and in a temperature-controlled tunnel (OBS) out yielded four other systems utilised in local hydroponic production of tomatoes. Shade net structures increased the incidence of early blight and fruit cracking, while production in a non-temperature-controlled tunnel resulted in a high incidence of fruit cracking. Spacing and stem pruning of tomatoes and sweet peppers in OBS resulted in increased yield and quality. The training facilities at ARC-VOPI are utilized for research, as well as training of resource poor farmers and community members who are trapped in a food security crisis. The beneficiaries are selected by GDARD, the main funder of the project, while ARC-VOPI provides training to empower the trainees to become financially independent"

The 30 entries were found to be diploid with genome sizes ranging from 2.31 to 2.45 pg/2C. Hand pollination experiments were carried out to assess self-incompatibility within the entries and revealed that they are self- and cross-compatible. For genetic diversity studies within and among the entries, the pooled data of 499 polymorphic bands from 11 amplified fragment length polymorphism primer combinations and nine simple sequence repeat markers were used. The genetic distance among the entries ranged from 0.13 to 0.77. In a principal coordinate analysis, the farmers’ cultivars formed a cluster separate from the advanced lines and the gene bank entries, and the latter were not well resolved. "

Such a framework consists of five pillars derived from the agricultural water vulnerability analysis. Design/methodology/approach: The method combined a new designed tool “ClimProspect”, adapted to the Sahelian climatic context, participatory and analogue approaches. Findings: Innovative “no regret” framework to overcome current and future climate risks on agricultural water requirements has been built. Research limitations/implications: The paper proposes a new way to assess vulnerability and build resilience for a given system and brings climate and disaster risks together. In fact, in the country, disaster and climate risks are closely associated. Practical implications: The proposed measures will reinforce water security under climate variability and change and disaster risks, boost the farmers’ participation in water governance and secure the adaptation investment for the long term. Social implications: Implementing the proposed measures should provide farmers with agricultural water needs at any time over the year, having access to social protection and sustainably increase their food security. Originality/value: Method used explicitly allows for paying attention, at the same time, to climate variability and change, disaster risks and social issues. The “no regret” framework is a practical secured tool for policy makers and planners, and it gives them a new way to secure sustainable water requirements. "

Specifically, we use a rural survey of 72 heads of household in three villages to examine whether and how (1) access to agricultural inputs, (2) debt and (3) liberalization reforms combine to produce rural socioeconomic differentiation based on wealth. We find that wealthier farmers use more mineral fertilizer and manure inputs than their poorer counterparts. Wealthier farmers are also better able to remain debt-free as cotton prices drop and input prices rise. Moreover, they are able to take advantage of the neo-liberal restructuring of cotton cooperatives to change polices on debt repayment and input provisioning to their favor. This growing divide has large implications for rural food security, particularly as land becomes scarcer, fallows disappear and the need to intensify production grows. This research addresses two gaps in the agrarian change literature in relating how liberalization reforms and biophysical elements drive rural socio-economic differentiation. This work also shows that merging the concerns of political ecology with the agrarian change literature allows for a deeper examination of rural socioeconomic differentiation. "

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the anthesis wheat growth stage is suitable for forecasting dryland wheat yields in the Central Free State region using satellite imagery and linear predictive modelling. A period of 10 years of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data smoothed with a Savitzky-Golay filter and 10 years of wheat yield data were used for model calibration. Diagnostic plots and statistical procedures were used for model validation and assessment of model adequacy. The period 30 days before harvest during the anthesis stage was established to be the best period during which to use the linear regression model. The calibrated model had a coefficient of determination of 0.73, a p-value of 0.00161 and a root mean squared error of 0.41 tons/ha. Residual plots confirmed that a linear model had a good fit for the data. The quantile-quantile plot provided evidence that the residuals were normally distributed, which means that assumptions of linear regression were fulfilled and the model can be used as a forecasting tool. Model validation showed high levels of accuracy. The evidence indicates that use of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data during the anthesis growth stage is a reliable, cost-effective and potentially time-saving alternative to ground-based surveys when forecasting dryland wheat yields in the Central Free State.

Evidences from different studies showed that health and nutrition problems are major barriers to educational access and achievement in low-income countries which poses a serious challenge on effort towards the achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Evidence on the link between food security and school attendance is very important to address this challenge. This study aimed to assess to what extent food insecurity affects school absenteeism among primary school adolescents. Methods: A school based cross-sectional study was conducted among primary school adolescents in Jimma zone from October-November, 2013. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data on the household food security and socio-demographic variables. Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 16.0 after checking for missing values and outliers. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association of school absenteeism and food insecurity with independent variables using odds ratio and 95 % of confidence intervals. Variables with p ≤ 0.25 in the bivariate analyses were entered into a multivariable regression analysis to control for associations among the independent variables. Results: The frequency of adolescent school absenteeism was significantly high (50.20 %) among food insecure households (P < 0.001) compared to their peers whose households were food secure (37.89 %). Findings of multivariable logistic regression analysis also showed that household food insecurity [AOR = 2.81 (1.70, 4.76)] was positively associated with poor school attendance while female-headed household [AOR = 0.23 (0.07, 0.72)], urban residence [AOR = 0.52 (0.36, 0.81)] and male-gender [AOR = 0.64 (0.54, 0.74)] were inversely associated with school absenteeism. Household food insecurity was positively associated with lack of maternal education [AOR = 2.26 (0.57, 8.93)] and poor household economic status [AOR = 1.39 (1.18, 2.83)]. However, livestock ownership [AOR = 0.17 (0.06, 0.51)] was negatively associated with household food insecurity. Conclusions: Findings of this study showed that household food insecurity has strong linkage with adolescent school absenteeism. Maternal education and household economic status were significantly associated with household food security status. Therefore, national policies and programs need to stress on how to improve family income earning capacity and socioeconomic status to handle household food insecurity which is a key contributor of adolescent school absenteeism.

A community based cross-sectional study was done from October to November, 2013. Data were gathered using structured questionnaires through interview of students and their caregivers. A total of 1000 students were selected by using simple random sampling methods using their rosters as a frame. Data were also checked for missing values and outliers, and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Regression analyses were used to see the strength of association between independent and dependent variables using odds ratios and 95% of confidence intervals. Adolescents from food insecure households had more reported illness (39.3%) than adolescents from food secure households (24.7%) (p < 0.001). Adolescents from food insecure households were two times more exposed to morbidity [AOR = 2.04(1.32, 3.14)] than adolescents from food secure households. This study also showed that males had 48% less reported illness [AOR = 0.52(0.01, 0.23)] than females. Adolescents who had attended health education had less reported illness [AOR = 0.57(0.38, 0.86)] than those who did not ever attend. This study also showed that having a farmer [AOR = 0.46(0.28, 0.74)] and government employee [AOR = 0.33 (0.17, 0.64)] father were inversely associated with adolescent morbidity. The findings of this study showed that household food insecurity, female gender and lack of attending health education had a significant contribution to adolescent morbidity. Therefore, there is a need to improve household income earning capacity and strengthen school based health and nutrition education to prevent adolescent morbidity. The findings of this study can also be used to lead the development of programs aimed at preventing adolescent morbidity by notifying policymakers and other stakeholders about the association of morbidity with household food insecurity.

The causal impact of technology adoption is estimated by utilizing endogenous switching regression. This helps us estimate the true welfare effect of technology adoption by controlling for the role of selection problem on production and adoption decisions. Our analysis reveals that adoption of improved agricultural technologies has a significant positive impact consumption expenditure (in per adult equivalent terms) in rural Ethiopia and Tanzania. This confirms the potential role of technology adoption in improving rural household welfare as higher consumption expenditure from improved technologies translate into lower poverty, higher food security and greater ability to withstand risk. An analysis of the determinants of adoption highlighted inadequate local supply of seed, access to information and perception about the new cultivars as key constraints for technology adoption. "

The high variation of annual maximum and minimum temperature has been similarly observed for decades in the stations. Ethiopia's average annual temperature has risen between 1955 and 2015 by 1.65 °C. The country's agricultural production depends heavily on local temperature and rainfall. The evidence is clear that a slight change in such climatic elements negatively affects the food security condition of both producers and consumers. Although data from the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) show that major cereal crop production has increased at the national level, partly due to the increasing application of fertilizers and modern seeds, Ethiopia's food security condition is deteriorating due to global climatic events caused droughts and rain failure. The rate of food price inflation is thus often higher than the general consumer price inflation rate. "

A literature review shows that while dams can boost power and agricultural production, promote economic development, and facilitate flood control, they can also lead to environmental, ecological, and socioeconomic changes. Several case studies show that dams may alter the composition and density of vectors and intermediate host species, increase the incidence of malaria schistosomiasis and possibly lymphatic filariasis, and lead to eutrophication of reservoirs, soil erosion, and earthquakes. There is evidence that dams and commercial irrigation schemes can increase soil and water degradation, vulnerability to drought, and food insecurity in riverine and lacustrine areas downstream of dams. It appears that dams in Ethiopia are also vulnerable to high soil erosion rates and earthquakes. Consequently, the current and proposed large-scale dam construction program in Ethiopia requires in-depth research to improve our understanding of the unintended negative effects of projects and to guide the location, design, and implementation of appropriate preventive and remedial programs.

Major investments in roads are bringing tens of millions of people effectively closer to major urban centers and services. Expansion of telecommunications, especially through cellular phones, likewise has connected much of the country and vastly improved the spread of information. The average electricity generation capacity during 1990-99 was 334 megawatts, and by 2010 that capacity had more than quadrupled, to 1,498 megawatts. During the same period, the capacity per capita almost tripled (from 6.0 watts to 17.4 watts). These advances are providing new opportunities for industrial production and modern services. These changes are remarkable, particularly given Ethiopia's history as a country of widespread poverty, exacerbated by severe droughts and major famines in the 1970s and 1980s. In the past two decades, public investments in agricultural development and the provision of safety nets have dramatically increased food security. Although there remains some debate over the size of cereal production increases, there is strong evidence to suggest that food production has indeed increased substantially, particularly in the 2000s, and that food security has improved at both the national and the household levels. Offi - cial production fi gures indicate that there was an average annual growth rate of 12 percent in cereal production between 2004/05 and 2007/08.1 Average per capita incomes rose from $131.7 in 2001 to $200.7 in 2009 (World Bank 2010).2 Malnutrition estimates in the mid-2000s showed a substantial decline in child mortality. The lack of nationally representative household data between 2005 and 2010 made it impossible to provide conclusive estimates of poverty and food insecurity when Ethiopia's new fi ve-year Growth and Transformation Plan was developed in 2010. Nonetheless, the apparent success of Ethiopia's agricultural and overall economic growth strategies prompted a major shift in development strategy, one involving a lesser role for agriculture and a much greater emphasis on industry and services for generating growth and poverty reduction.

Four farm types per city and overall six: commercial livestock (cLS), commercial vegetable crop (cVC), subsistence field crop (sFC), cLScVC, cLScVCsFC and sVCsFC were identified across the three cities. Two types, cLS and cLScVC were common to the three cities. The farm types differed in resource endowment, income, soil fertility management and nutrient balances. cLS systems accumulated 450, 85 and 260 kg N, P and K ha−1 year−1 and had 26% N and P and 15% K use efficiency, respectively while sFC systems depleted − 30 kg N and − 17 kg K ha−1 year−1 and had 155% N and > 100% K use efficiency. There was little exchange of manure and crop residue between LS, FC and VC systems. To use the potential role of UPA in nutrient re-cycling, a directive that imposes LS systems to distribute their surplus manure resources to proximate FC and VC systems and improve their nutrient use efficiency should be put in place.

We find that women are disempowered across all five domains of empowerment due to cultural factors, despite government and financial institution policy changes. Women with low education tend to engage in low risk/return farming practices, including growing less nutritious crops, thereby undermining nutritional security of the household. Our findings confirm that women's role increases to as much as 80 percent in post-harvest. Poor storage technologies resulting in fungal/pest infections and chemicals in stored grains pose serious health risks for women, and poor women consume grains with up to 50 percent damage. Food security and development policies should empower women and promote improved technologies—particularly targeting women—to reduce grain losses and women's work burden while mitigating health risks.

Vitamin B-12 deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia and impairs growth and development in children. Objective: We measured vitamin B-12 in breast milk and examined its associations with household hunger, recent animalsource food consumption, and vitamin B-12 intake. Methods: In a cross-sectional substudy nested within a cluster-randomized trial assessing water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions in Kenya, we sampled 286 women 1-6 mo postpartum. Mothers hand-expressed breast milk 1 min into a feeding after 90 min observed nonbreastfeeding. The Household Hunger Scale was used to measure hunger, food intake in the previous week was measured with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and vitamin B-12 intake was estimated by using 24-h dietary recall. An animal-source food score was based on 10 items from the FFQ (range: 0-70). Breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was measured with the use of a solid-phase competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and was modeled with linear regression. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlated observations at the cluster level. Results: Median (IQR) vitamin B-12 intake was 1.5 μg/d (0.3, 9.7 mg/d), and 60% of women consumed < 2.4 μg/d, the estimated average requirement during lactation. Median (IQR) breast milk vitamin B-12 concentration was 113 pmol/L (61, 199 pmol/L); 89% had concentrations < 310 pmol/L, the estimated adequate concentration. Moderate or severe hunger prevalence was 27%; the animal-source food score ranged from 0 to 30 item-d/wk. Hunger and recent animal-source food and vitamin B-12 intake were not associated with breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. Maternal age was negatively associated with breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. Conclusion: Most lactating Kenyan women consumed less than the estimated average requirement of vitamin B-12 and had low breast milk vitamin B-12 concentrations. We recommend interventions that improve vitamin B-12 intake in lactating Kenyan women to foster maternal health and child development. "

Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, although linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100 kg N ha−1, NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the geos-chem chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63 ppbv under fertilization rates of 150 kg N ha−1 or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately 110 ppbh for inputs of 150 kg N ha−1 during the March–April–May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity. Our results suggest that it may be possible to manage Kenyan agricultural systems for high yields while avoiding substantial impacts on air quality. "

In particular, the use of fertilizer trees has been promoted as a practice that contributes to improved soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, by increasing supply of nutrients for crop production. While a lot of the evidence on the impact of fertilizer trees relies on on-farm experiments and correlational analysis, there is a paucity of rigorous evidence under actual smallholder farming conditions. This paper analyzes the impacts of adopting fertilizer trees such as Gliricidia sepium and Faidherbia albida on household food security. We draw on survey data of 338 farmers in Malawi and use an endogenous switching regression to rigorously analyze adoption impacts. Econometric results show that use of fertilizer tree adoption increases the value of food crops by 35%. Disaggregation of the impacts through stratification by land ownership further reveal that farmers with smaller farms of up to 2 acres realize the highest gains. Furthermore, fertilizer tree use in conjunction with improved maize seed also significantly increased value of food crops. This study offers preliminary insights that contribute to an emerging field of research on quantitative assessment of agricultural interventions such as agroforestry practices using novel analytical approaches. We provide some policy insights and recommend the need for future research to be designed around development initiatives that consider fine-scale variation in social, economic and ecological context of farmers to improve uptake and adaptation to realize the full potential of agroforestry in improving soil fertility and household food security.

In this paper we adopt a very simple micro-based simulation approach to analyze how changes in prices of specific food groups, such as maize prices or prices for staple foods, as well as how negative short-term household level income shocks affect the entitlements to calorie consumption of individuals and how these changes affect overall food poverty. We illustrate our approach using household survey data from Malawi. We find that food poverty is of serious concern with large within-country variations. We find that price shocks for staple foods have a considerable impact on food security with particularly strong effects on poor net food buyers in rural and urban areas. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to estimate food security impacts of price and income shocks ex ante in a relatively straightforward fashion that can be done relatively quickly and that is suitable for cross-country assessments of the likely impacts of shocks on food security and the design of appropriate response measures.

We find that the main conclusions from these research processes appear plausible even if they point to diverging paths of poverty. These results are attributed to methodological challenges and especially to different perceptions about the determinants of poverty that each approach conveys. Using a Q-Squared approach we illustrate that when definitions of poverty based on the perceptions raised in the qualitative assessments are used on the quantitative data then the results tend to converge. One particularly interesting finding is that those identified as poor using the official poverty measure, established explicitly to capture deprivation in consumption expenditure, have higher average levels of consumption expenditure than a combined Q-Squared measure based exclusively on non-monetary criteria. We generally find that while there might have been a real improvement in consumption-based measures of poverty over time, given the emphasis on issues related to assets, access to and quality of delivery of basic services, and issues related to vulnerabilities (especially food insecurity and the AIDS epidemic) in the participatory poverty assessments, it is not surprising that the qualitative data point to deteriorating living conditions.

Data from the 2010 National Survey on Households' Vulnerability to Food Insecurity done by the National Institute of Statistics is used. The study shows that asset and social safety net indicators are significant and have a positive impact on households' resilience. Climate change approximated by long-term mean rainfall has a negative and significant effect on households' resilience. Therefore, to strengthen households' resilience to food insecurity, there is a need to increase assistance to households through social safety nets and to help them gather more resources in order to acquire more assets.

Yet about 56 per cent of the total population lives in absolute poverty. This article confronts conventional theories of poverty with the indigenous thoughts of the Yoruba (one of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria). Darwinian, individualistic, cultural, situational and structural theories of poverty associate it either with individual-case or economy-wide factors. Approaching anti-poverty strategy through individual-related factors (such as training the unskilled poor) without due consideration to the economy-wide factors (such as job creation for the poor) ends up redistributing rather than actually reducing aggregate poverty. The analysis of poverty-related proverbs of the Yoruba reveals a consistency between the conventional theories and what the Yoruba think about poverty. The Yoruba believe in chronic (osi) versus transitory (ise) poverty, associated with suffering. They believe that poor people can escape the poverty trap through their own personal efforts (such as by developing a positive work attitude, working hard and reducing their family size) along with the help of support systems (such as job creation and food security). The Yoruba believe that job creation is the best anti-poverty strategy. They further believe that by removing hunger, poverty becomes insignificant. Based on these two axioms, this article suggests that attention be paid to job creation and food security for the poor. It also recommends that studies of the socioeconomic thought of the other major Nigerian tribes with respect to poverty be undertaken, so as to arrive at nationally and culturally derived anti-poverty strategies in Nigeria.

This calls for proper understanding of spatial-temporal variations of quality and quantity of water to ensure sustainable management. The number of hydro-meteorological stations such as rainfall stations and flow measuring stations has not increased and even the functioning of the existing ones is deteriorating. Satellite rainfall estimates (SRE) are being used widely in place of gauge observations or to supplement gauge observations. However, rigorous validation is necessary to have some level of confidence in using the satellite products for different applications. This paper discusses the results of application of SRE over a data scarce tropical complex region in Northeast Tanzania. We selected river catchments found in two different climatological zones: the inland region mountains (i.e. Kikuletwa and Ruvu basins) and the coastal region mountains (i.e. Mkomazi, Luengera and Zigi basins), characterized by semi arid, sub-humid to humid tropical climate. Thus, the validation sites were ideal for testing the different SRE products. In this study, we evaluated two gauge corrected high resolution SRE products which combine both infrared and passive-microwave estimates; the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center (NOAA-CPC) African Rainfall Estimation (RFE2) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission product 3B42 (TRMM-3B42) using station network.The accuracy of the products was evaluated through a comparison with available gauge data. The comparison was made on pair-wise (point to pixel) and sub-basin level with the reproduction of rainfall volume, rainfall intensity and consistency of rain and no-rain days. The SRE products performed reasonably well over both regions in detecting the occurrence of rainfall. The underestimation was mainly ascribed to topology and the coastal effect. Whereas, the overestimation was mainly ascribed to evaporation of rainfall in the dry atmosphere under the cloud base. Local calibration of satellite-derived rainfall estimates and merging of satellite estimates with locally available rain-gauge observations are some of the approaches that could be employed to alleviate these problems. Although, the products did not show strong correlation to the observed rainfall over the complex tropical mountainous catchments considered, they have high potential to augment gauge observations in data sparse basins.

This paper presents a comparison of output and use of purchased inputs between the rural and urban farmers in Ohafia, south-east Nigeria. Although farm sizes were larger in the rural than in the urban areas, this difference was not statistically significant, apparently because many farmers in the urban areas also purchased farmland in the rural areas. The uses of all the purchased inputs except hired labour were significantly higher in the urban than in the rural areas, indicating efforts by urban farmers to retain soil nutrients in the face of continuous cropping. The use of hired labour did not differ in the two locations, mainly because the aged are involved in agriculture everywhere. Output was however significantly lower in the urban than in the rural areas, apparently because farmers in the urban areas are poor and hence undercapitalized to use adequate amounts of purchased inputs to retain soil nutrients. This observation suggests that if urban agriculture is to act as one of the options for tackling urban food insecurity, the urban poor should be sufficiently empowered financially, not only to apply purchased inputs in the right quantities, but also to adopt innovations in their farming businesses"

Nevertheless, in spite of its vital functions in developing countries, urban horticulture suffers from a lack of recognition and carries little economic weight. This is explained by its use of scarce resources and the health and environmental risks associated with its practice. This situation is well put in evidence in the specific case of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, the city that features as the subject of field research conducted for this article. The study aims at making a forward-looking analysis of the agricultural activity in this city and to supply information for the decision-making support relative to its expansion. The characterization made from field data unveils an activity dominated by truck farming that provisions the urban markets of the city with more than 90% of its intake of fruits and vegetables. Truck farmers are subjected to the scarcity and controversial availability of land and water resources, as well as to the rudimentary character of the equipments used, the poor quality of soils, and the health risks associated with the use of untreated waste water, chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The skills of Ouagadougou's farmers are not adequate enough to sustain a prosperous agricultural activity. Indeed, most of them had no formal schooling or training and do not have the required knowledge of agro-pedagogical, economic, environmental and sanitary issues. The key challenge facing the development of the agricultural activity in Ouagadougou is land use and access and the insecurity that deters investors from committing resources to the development of the sector. A spatial inventory reveals the existence of 102 agricultural sites distributed on 35 zones. This inventory proves that far from receding or being pushed aside, the agricultural activity does not stop growing in spite of a quasi-ban due to the ""fuzzy"" legal character that surrounds it and the constraints that characterizes it. The adoption of the SDAGO horizon 2025, a national large-scale document adopted during the Council of Ministers, designates green spaces to be rehabilitated on the municipality's territory.

The public health situation is severe with health facilities few and far in-between; lack of access to clean water and safe sanitation; and many households suffering from diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, skin diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Environmental protection arrangements are in place in all sites, however, the awareness of protected areas and their benefits is low and many feel helpless in protecting the environment. Climate change-increasing periods of drought and irregular rainfall-contribute to food insecurity and health problems. The interconnectedness between these stressors reinforces the need for an integrated approach to addressing coastal conservation and community development in the SANAPA area. "

Data on demography, nutritional requirements, food imports and exports, climate and hydrology are used to create scenarios about meeting future water requirements for food production while simultaneously satisfying the water requirements of other sectors. The simulation results highlight the need to improve productivity in irrigation and also intensify rainfed agriculture to avoid future food insecurity, especially under high population projections. Merely expanding irrigated areas will not make significant impacts on national-level food security.

Material in the various genebanks is maintained either as seed in seed stores, in vivo in field and glass house genebanks or in vitro in tissue culture. Most of these collections are linked to active research programs at the institute with direct utilization in either breeding programs, plant pathology or cultivation research leading to the development of new cultivars and technologies. The genebank for example supports the only potato breeding program on the African continent. The development of cultivars adapted to the warmer and dryer climates can contribute to the availability of material that can address climate change and play a role in food security in rural areas. Besides the research outputs the genetic resources maintained at ARC-Roodeplaat VOPI play an important role in the sustainability of farmers. As the only source of disease-free and indexed material of potato, sweet potato and Lachenalia flower bulb cultivars in South Africa, the supply of material from the genebank ensures that farmers receive quality material to sustain good harvests, meet the demand for production as well as contribute towards food security. The potato genebank in this regard is the start of the potato certification scheme supporting the R 4.5 billion local potato industry and the sweet potato disease-tested scheme serves the R 34 million industry. Similarly, the traditional and indigenous vegetable genebank is the only seed source of certain species available in the country, leading to requests for seed from a variety of role-players.

The results indicate a beneficial effect of e'Pap for both study populations, and particularly for adult TB patients, whose baseline data reflected severe food insecurity and malnutrition in the majority of cases. There is evidence to suggest statistically significant improvements in key micronutrient levels, well-being and energy, hand-grip strength, the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) Illness Marker, and certain clinical indicators. Although Body Mass Index (BMI) and Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) are frequently used as standard measures to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional interventions, these indicators were not sufficiently sensitive in this study. Nor does weight gain necessarily indicate improved nutritional status.

South Africa is a middle-income country with a highly dualistic agro-food system, dealing with the burden of undernutrition, diet-related chronic diseases and widespread micronutrient malnutrition. In South Africa, agriculture must maintain national food security while contributing to improving household food security through employment and production for own consumption; and providing access to a more diverse range of safe and quality foods at affordable prices. Agricultural activities can contribute to improved nutrition, if implemented in conjunction with direct nutrition interventions. This study gives an overview of the nutritional status of the South African population, and the history and current operations of the agro-food system. It identifies entry points for nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) to begin to address food and nutrition security challenges. Case studies were identified using grey literature. With few exceptions, these cases were not NSA initiatives per se, yet demonstrated efforts that could inform actions to strengthen the nutrition-sensitivity of the South African food system. NSA is not an all-encompassing solution to food and nutrition insecurity in South Africa, but offers a way of strengthening the nutrition-sensitivity of agricultural initiatives. Viable entry points include linking small scale production and nutrition education; combining low external input farming and nutrition education; strengthening alternative marketing channels and local food economies; monitoring food prices; and developing appropriate governance and institutional arrangements.

Historically, research and extension has concentrated on staples to the comparative neglect of vegetables despite being important component of daily dietary intake and source of income for small-holders. Current research and extension, which is primarily donor-driven, is focused on a few selected crops and problems, and is not necessarily addressing the real needs of the producers and local consumers. There is a growing awareness that, while staples remain as the key component of food security in Africa, improved production of vegetables in small-scale farming systems is urgently needed for provision of a balanced diet for the growing population. On parallel basis, the use of pesticides has to be reduced, and therefore, the need for IPM in vegetable production. With the growing awareness of the needs for IPM research and technology transfer in Eastern and Southern Africa and an increasing number of projects and NGO groups becoming involved in small-holder vegetable production, there is a need to try to enhance collaboration in the region to reduce duplication and optimise on scarce resources so as to improve production and increase profits from vegetable production.

The causes of the food crises were many and its impacts complex. Policies to address those causes are accordingly numerous and complex, as they must address both the various underlying structural causes of food price spikes and increased volatility as well as the consequences of shorter-term transitory shocks that reinforced the structural factors. Prominent among these interventions should be increasing public and private investment in agricultural productivity and in physical and social infrastructure, expanding trade, decreasing biofuels subsidies in industrialized countries, and dealing with long-term climate change. Africa played no role in the origins of the financial and economic crises but nonetheless suffered their consequences in the form of lower economic growth, macro imbalances, increased poverty and undernutrition. As a price-taker in most commodity and financial markets, mitigating the repercussions of future such crises means enhancing the resilience of African economies. This can be accomplished through measures ranging from improved short-term macroeconomic policies to longer-term growth strategies that emphasize economic diversification, reinvestment of export earnings, and increasing investment in infrastructure and human capital. Given the magnitude of poverty across the continent, more effective social protection programmes will also be important in cushioning the impacts of future crises on the poor. "

More specifically, the results revealed that the probability of women to adopt fishfarming technology was higher than that of men. This was likely because fish farmingmet women objectives of food security, immobility of women due to homeresponsibilities and lack of alternative opportunities among women. Yet, women hadlesser access to resources necessary for adoption of fish farming technology and wereless reached by extension services than men.

The study is based on a household survey of 899 farmers in a semi-arid and a sub-humid region in Tanzania. It was found that (a) significant differences in perceptions of the environment by farmers can be attributed to agro-climatic location, while the distance to a water source has less impact on individual perception; (b) differently perceived changes affect individual water availability and food security; and (c) the farm level adaptation methods applied are linked to vulnerability to changes and the household dependence on the immediate environment.

Among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania has an abundance of natural resources and major agricultural potential. However, one of the most important constraints facing Tanzania’s agricultural sector is the dependence on unreliable and irregular weather, including rainfall. A strategy to cope with climate uncertainty in semi-arid regions is to proceed with the sowing of the crop before the onset of the rainy season. The advantage is that when the rains start, seeds are already in the soil and can begin immediately the process of germination. The objective of this paper was to assess the effectiveness of dry-soil planting for maize as an adaptation strategy in the context of a changing climate in Dodoma, a semi-arid region in Tanzania. For this assessment, the DSSAT crop model was used in combination with climate scenarios based on representative concentration pathways. A probability of crop failure of more than 80% can be expected when sowing occurs during the planting window (of 21 days) starting on 1st November. The next planting window we assessed, starting on 23rd November (which was still before the onset of rain), presented significantly lower probabilities of crop failure, indicating that sowing before the onset of the rainy season is a suitable adaptation strategy. Results also indicated that, despite not reaching the highest maize grain yields, fields prepared for dry-soil planting still produced adequate yields. The cultivation of several fields using the dry planting method is a strategy farmers can use to cope with low rainfall conditions, since it increases the chances of harvesting at least some of the cultivated fields. We conclude that dry-soil planting is a feasible and valid technique, even in scenarios of climate change, in order to provide acceptable maize yields in semi-arid Tanzania. "

Lately the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) due to H5N1 virus, has become an international crisis as all regions around the world can be considered at risk. In the past decades, public health authorities within industrialized countries have been faced with an increasing number of food safety issues. The situation is equally serious in developing countries. The globalization of food (and feed) trade, facilitated by the liberalization of world trade, while offering many benefits and opportunities, also represents new risks. The GF-TADs Global Secretariat has carried out several regional consultations for the identification of priority diseases and best ways for their administration, prevention and control. In the questionnaires carried out and through the consultative process, it was noted that globally, FMD was ranked as the first and foremost priority. Rift Valley fever, and today highly pathogenic avian influenza, are defined as major animal diseases which also affect human health. PPR and CBPP, a disease which is particularly serious in Africa and finally, African swine fever (ASF) and classical swine fever (CSF) are also regionally recognised as top priorities on which the Framework is determined to work. The FAO philosophy - shared by the OIE - embraces the need to prevent and control TADs and emerging diseases at their source, which is most of the time in developing countries. Regional and international approaches have to be followed, and the FAO and OIE GF-TADs initiative provides the appropriate concepts and objectives as well as an organizational framework to link international and regional organizations at the service of their countries to better prevent and control the risks on animal and human health and the economic impact of TADs and emerging animal diseases.

It is based on a survey of 127 households in 8 villages located in the semi-arid zone of Makueni district, Kenya. Results show that in average seasons there is a significant positive correlation between farm size and maize yields while this relation is not significant in seasons affected by drought. This implies that under different conditions increasing farm size may not lead to increased crop yields. The farm produce in average seasons cannot sustain many households until food is available from the next harvest, either because the proportion stored for consumption was small compared to the amount sold, or the harvest was little. In the context of actor strategies, there is a difference between a female-headed household where there is a complete absence of a man and a female managed household (FMH) where the male household head is a migrant worker living off-plot. In the latter case, decision-making and control of assets, including produce marketing, remain largely with the husbands. The analytical implication is that the common definition of a household as a group of people eating from the same pot is not valid for such cases. Another implication is that while the workload for women in the two aforementioned household types might be the same, women in FMHs have limited access to and control over use of household income and resources. Thus, men control the sale of produce and they sell mostly to middlemen, who dominate farm produce marketing. The compulsion to sell produce immediately after harvest in order to have cash for immediate expenses exposes the households to the risk of food insecurity and to low incomes from produce sales, compared to the income they would earn if they waited and sold at intervals, or compared to the value of inputs (time, labour and money) they invested to achieve the yields. However, the farmers do not organize themselves in groups to improve their position in produce sales. In produce preservation and storage, the control of pests is a major challenge to many households. Farmers select their seeds from previous harvests, whereby they prefer local maize varieties to improved varieties due to the low cost in accessing them, their perceived drought resistant characteristic and higher productivity. Based on the foregoing, incentives for mechanisation and the use of appropriate inputs should be promoted in order to increase and preserve yields. Access to sources of cash such as community banks, which at the moment only exists in one village, can be a viable alternative to the compulsion of selling produce at unfavourable prices even at the risk of experiencing food shortages.

Using survey data from Tharaka-Nithi County, we find 100% of millet and sorghum farmers in the study area scare birds from their plot, devoting 43-66% of all labour time to this activity when these crops are grown in monocrop plots and 24-47% of labour time in plots where millet and sorghum are grown in combination with other crops. This labour allocation is in stark contrast to farmers of all other crops who dedicate almost no time to bird scaring. Individually scaring birds from their plot, farmers achieve a 'momentary Pareto optimal', perpetuating a 'ripple effect' whereby the negative cost of birds are continuously shifted from one farmer to the next. We systematically examine this cost-shifting behaviour as an externality, theoretically applying environmental and resource economics (ERE) policy prescriptions for externality internalisation. ERE, however, with its focus on self-interest, rational actors and technological interventions, falls short to present effective solutions to this so-called externality. Farmers in the region can address crop raids by birds through collective, coordinated action. At this scale, the negative cost of pests is deliberately distributed across all receptors, leading to long-term, community-wide social wellbeing improvements. "

Consequently, the judicious and scientific management of soil and water resources is essential to meet the increasing demand of cereals. Soil management practices have profound impacts on soil fertility, which is closely linked to land productivity. As soil processes are often slow, it is only through long-term management that they can improve soil characteristics to enhance crop production. The need to increase the grain yield of cereals per unit is of utmost importance in the developing countries [19]. Wheat is considered one of the most important and strategically cereal crop in Egypt, but cultivated area only produces about 30% of the domestic need. One of several technologies to increase wheat production is an appropriate application of organic matters, especially in the newly reclaimed areas [29]. "

During the 20th century, desert locust control operations began organizing, and nowadays, they are coordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which promotes a preventative strategy based on early warning and rapid response. This strategy implies a constant monitoring of the populations and of the ecological conditions favorable to their development. Satellite remote sensing can provide a near real-time monitoring of these conditions at the continental scale. Thus, the desert locust control community needs a reliable detection of green vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas as an indicator of potential desert locust habitat. To meet this need, a colorimetric transformation has been developed on both SPOT-VEGETATION and MODIS data to produce dynamic greenness maps. After their integration in the daily locust control activities, this research aimed at assessing those dynamic greenness maps from the producers' and the users' points of view. Eight confusion matrices and Pareto boundaries were derived from high resolution reference maps representative of the temporal and spatial diversity of Mauritanian habitats. The dynamic greenness maps were found to be accurate in summer breeding areas (F-score = 0.64-0.87), but accuracy dropped in winter breeding areas (F-score = 0.28-0.40). Accuracy is related to landscape fragmentation (R2 = 0.9): the current spatial resolution remains too coarse to resolve complex fragmented patterns and accounts for a substantial (60%) part of the error. The exploitation of PROBA-V 100-m images at the finest resolution (100-m) would enhance by 20% the vegetation detection in fragmented habitat. A survey revealed that end-users are satisfied with the product and find it fit for monitoring, thanks to an intuitive interpretation, leading to more efficiency. "

Associated problems include soil erosion, nutrient mining, competition for biomass for multiple uses, limited application of inorganic fertilizers, and limited capacity of farmers to recognize the decline in soil quality and its consequences on productivity. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is an approach to improve crop yields, while preserving sustainable and long-term soil fertility through the combined judicious use of fertilizers, recycled organic resources, responsive crop varieties, and improved agronomic practices, which minimize nutrient losses and improve the nutrient-use efficiency of crops. Soil fertility and nutrient management studies in Ethiopia under on-station and on-farm conditions showed that the combined application of inorganic and organic fertilizers significantly increased crop yields compared to either alone in tropical agro-ecosystems. Yield benefits were more apparent when fertilizer application was accompanied by crop rotation, green manuring, or crop residue management. The combination of manure and NP fertilizer could increase wheat and faba bean grain yields by 50%–100%, whereas crop rotation with grain legumes could increase cereal grain yields by up to 200%. Although organic residues are key inputs for soil fertility management, about 85% of these residues is used for livestock feed and energy; thus, there is a need for increasing crop biomass. The main incentive for farmers to adopt ISFM practices is economic benefits. The success of ISFM also depends on research and development institutions to provide technical support, technology adoption, information dissemination, and creation of market incentives for farmers in tropical agro-ecosystems.

Much of the literature suggests that post-apartheid interventions have not been successful at improving small-scale agriculture, which is seen as an important vehicle for improving rural food security. Nevertheless, data from the General Household Survey (GHS) indicate that household hunger levels have declined substantially in the post-2000 decade across the entire nation (as other estimates of household poverty have also indicated). In particular, this paper demonstrates that this trend has been more pronounced in the former homeland regions, eliminating the previously higher incidence of hunger there. Using linear probability models, this paper seeks to isolate which factors have led to the convergence of the homeland regions household hunger levels and those of households residing in non-homeland parts of the country. The historical context that is sketched here highlights the severe challenges faced by farmers in former homeland areas; this raises the question how convergence in food security occurred, given that many agricultural interventions in rural areas (also in homelands) have not attained the success that was hoped for. In particular, the proportionately larger reliance on social grants in homelands regions accounts for a part of the faster reduction in hunger levels there. Communal gardens and connections to the agricultural market have also reduced hunger within former homelands regions. The long-term sustainability of grants in bolstering food security is of concern, highlighting the need for greater market integration of small-scale farmers in homeland regions. "

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how high-resolution satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to assess the spatial variability of yield, and yield response to fertilizer. The study included 48 and 50 smallholder fields monitored during the 2014 and 2015 cropping seasons south-east of Koutiala (Mali), cropped with the five major crops grown in the area (cotton, maize, sorghum, millet and peanuts). Each field included up to five plots with different fertilizer applications and one plot with farmer practice. Fortnightly, in-situ in each field data were collected synchronous with UAV imaging using a Canon S110 NIR camera. A concurrent series of very high-resolution satellite images was procured and these images were used to mask out trees. For each plot, we calculated vegetation index means, medians and coefficients of variation. Cross-validated general linear models were used to assess the predictability of relative differences in crop yield and yield response to fertilizer, explicitly accounting for the effects of fertility treatments, between-field and within-field variabilities. Differences between fields accounted for a much larger component of variation than differences between fertilization treatments. Vegetation indices from UAV images strongly related to ground cover (R2 = 0.85), light interception (R2 = 0.79) and vegetation indices derived from satellite images (R2 values of about 0.8). Within-plot distributions of UAV-derived vegetation index values were negatively skewed, and within-plot variability of vegetation index values was negatively correlated with yield. Plots on shallow soils with poor growing conditions showed the largest within-plot variability. GLM models including UAV derived estimates of light interception explained up to 78% of the variation in crop yield and 74% of the variation in fertilizer response within a single field. These numbers dropped to about 45% of the variation in yield and about 48% of the variation in fertilizer response when lumping all fields of a given crop, with Q2 values of respectively 22 and 40% respectively when tested with a leave-field-out procedure. This indicates that remotely sensed imagery doesn't fully capture the influence of crop stress and management. Assessment of crop fertilizer responses with vegetation indices therefore needs a reference under similar management. Spatial variability in UAV-derived vegetation index values at the plot scale was significantly related to differences in yields and fertilizer responses. The strong relationships between light interception and ground cover indicate that combining vertical photographs or high-resolution remotely sensed vegetation indices with crop growth models allows to explicitly account for the spatial variability and will improve the accuracy of yield and crop production assessments, especially in heterogeneous smallholder conditions.

Blantyre in Malawi presents a useful case study for demonstrating the importance of linking gender and urban food security. Rates of urban food insecurity are less severe than in other cities surveyed by AFSUN. Yet female-centred households were twice as likely to be severely food insecure as nuclear households. This paper offers some explanations for the survey findings by drawing on qualitative research to understand the gendered geographies of food access in Blantyre. The first point is that gender shapes mobility, which in turn shapes a household’s ability to increase its food security by procuring food from the most affordable sources, particularly peri-urban markets. The second point is that gender shapes a household’s ability to produce its own food, a popular livelihood strategy in Blantyre that often mitigates the effects of low incomes on household food security. The third point is that gender influences a person’s potential income, which shapes the household’s economic access to food. These three points demonstrate the multi-dimensional relationship between gender and urban food security. "

The Butajira Rural Health Programme (BRHP) in Ethiopia has maintained a programme of epidemiological surveillance since 1987. Inspection of the BRHP data revealed large peaks of mortality in 1998 and 1999, well in excess of the normally observed year-to-year variation. Further investigation and enquiry revealed that these peaks related to a measles epidemic, and a serious episode of drought and consequent food insecurity that went undetected by the BRHP. This paper applies international humanitarian crisis threshold definitions to the BRHP data in an attempt to identify suitable mortality thresholds that may be used for the prospective detection of humanitarian crises in population surveillance sites in developing countries. Study design: Empirical investigation using secondary analysis of longitudinal population-based cohort data. Methods: The daily, weekly and monthly thresholds for crises in Butajira were applied to mortality data for the 5-year period incorporating the crisis periods of 1998-1999. Days, weeks and months in which mortality exceeded each threshold level were identified. Each threshold level was assessed in terms of prospectively identifying the true crisis periods in a timely manner whilst avoiding false alarms. Results: The daily threshold definition is too sensitive to accurately detect impending or real crises in the population surveillance setting of the BRHP. However, the weekly threshold level is useful in identifying important increases in mortality in a timely manner without the excessive sensitivity of the daily threshold. The weekly threshold level detects the crisis periods approximately 2 weeks before the monthly threshold level. Conclusion: Mortality measures are highly specific indicators of the health status of populations, and simple procedures can be used to apply international crisis threshold definitions in population surveillance settings for the prospective detection of important changes in mortality rate. Standards for the timely use of surveillance data and ethical responsibilities of those responsible for the data should be made explicit to improve the public health functioning of current sentinel surveillance methodologies.

Lessons learned from previous interventions and successes elsewhere from countries comparable to Uganda are drawn and future perspectives to guide effective irrigation planning and development are recommended. From this paper, it is evident that there is no single blanket solution to constraints of irrigation development in SSA. All strategies should be implemented in a holistic manner dictated by specific local conditions. The key to successful adoption of irrigation lies in building the national irrigation capacity, improving access to reliable water for irrigation in proximity of the farms, streamlining extension services for farmers, addressing economic aspects of irrigation, and streamlining land tenure systems and management. It is recommended to operationalize government policy on irrigation by developing national guidelines on irrigated agriculture. "

Yet, despite preliminary evidence connecting food insecurity to political violence, we lack a systematic understanding of the relationship(s) between local food resources and violence against civilians. This study develops a food-security based theory to explain the significant variation that we observe in violence against civilians across both time and subnational geographic space. We argue that combatants, be they government or rebel actors, often must turn to local agricultural resources for sustenance. During times of relative peace, armed actors and civilians have long time horizons, and the prospects of repeated interactions thereby promote a strategy of co-optation to obtain food resources. However, the existence of immediate conflict in a region leads armed actors to discount the benefits of future interactions in favor of obtaining food immediately, using violence if necessary. In estimating a series of statistical models on a sample of all African countries (1997–2009), we find robust support for our expectations: cropland increases the frequency of violence against civilians during periods of conflict, but has an added pacifying effect during times of peace.

Despite its presumed importance, there is large variation in the importance and type of food losses and wastage. We identify the levels of food wastage at various levels of the potato food chain for three Asian countries. Methodology/approach - Surveys were fielded to better measure the important variation between value chain agents, to capture wastage at each level, to analyze the structure of the value chain, and to evaluate wastage over the whole value chain (except for consumption). We generate data on an important staple in these countries and analyze the importance of waste in domestic rural-urban food value chains, often the most important value chain in these countries. Findings - We find total quantities of potatoes wasted are equal to 5.2% in the harvest period and 6.4% in the off-season of all quantities that enter the value chain for Bangladesh. Even lower numbers are obtained in India (3.2% and 3.3%, respectively). These wastage levels are higher in China, possibly because of the significantly longer distances that potatoes are shipped. Practical implications - The use of cold storage facilities can minimize the level of wastage in the potato distribution chain. Studies of this type of storage for other countries and commodities can identify opportunities in which adoption of cold storage can provide the greatest contributions toward the elimination of food wastage.

People living there have accumulated traditional knowledge about plants. However, with economic development, WEPs are threatened and the associated traditional knowledge is in danger of being lost. Therefore, ethnobotanical surveys were conducted throughout this area to investigate and document the wild edible plants traditionally used by local Tibetan people.Methods: Twenty-nine villages were selected to carry out the field investigations. Information was collected using direct observation, semi-structured interviews, individual discussions, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, questionnaires and participatory rural appraisal (PRA).Results: Information about 168 wild edible plant species in 116 genera of 62 families was recorded and specimens were collected. Most species were edible greens (80 species) or fruits (78). These WEPs are sources for local people, especially those living in remote rural areas, to obtain mineral elements and vitamins. More than half of the species (70%) have multiple use(s) besides food value. Some are crop wild relatives that could be used for crop improvement. Several also have potential values for further commercial exploitation. However, the utilization of WEPs and related knowledge are eroding rapidly, especially in the areas with convenient transportation and booming tourism.Conclusion: Wild food plants species are abundant and diverse in Shangri-la region. They provide food and nutrients to local people and could also be a source of cash income. However, both WEPs and their associated indigenous knowledge are facing various threats. Thus, conservation and sustainable utilization of these plants in this area are of the utmost importance.

As a key area for food production that is sensitive to climate change, the agro-pastoral transitional zone (APTZ) plays a significant role in regional food security. To investigate the respective effects of crop distribution and climate change on crop production, the well-established GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model was adopted with different scenario designs in this study. From 1980 to 2010, the crop distribution for wheat, maize, and rice witnessed a dramatic change due to agricultural policy adjustments and ecological engineering-related construction in the APTZ. At the same time, notable climate change was observed. The simulation results indicated that the climate change had a positive impact on the crop production of wheat, maize, and rice, while the crop distribution change led to an increase in the production of maize and rice, but a decrease in the wheat production. Comparatively, crop distribution change had a larger impact on wheat (–1.71 × 106 t) and maize (8.53 × 106 t) production, whereas climate change exerted a greater effect on rice production (0.58 × 106 t), during the period from 1980 to 2010 in the APTZ.

With China being one of the major global producers and consumers of rice, achieving a sustainable balance in maximizing crop productivity and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields in this country becomes increasingly important. This study examined the effects of applying steel slag, a residual product derived from the steel industry, on crop yield and CH4 and N2O emissions over multiple growing seasons in a Chinese subtropical paddy field. Average CH4 emission was considerably higher during the periods of rice crop growth compared to that during the periods of fallowing and vegetable crop growth, regardless of the amount of steel slag applied. When compared to the controls, significantly lower mean emissions of CH4 (1.03 vs. 2.34mgm-2h-1) and N2O (0.41 vs. 32.43μgm-2h-1) were obtained in plots with slag addition at a rate of 8Mgha-1 over the study period. The application of slag at 8Mgha-1 increased crop yields by 4.2 and 9.1% for early and late rice crops, respectively, probably due to the higher availability of inorganic nutrients such as silicates and calcium from the slag. Slag addition had no significant effect on the concentrations of heavy metals in either the soil or the rice grains, although a slight increase in the levels of manganese and cobalt in the soil and a decrease in the levels of manganese and zinc in the rice grains were observed. Our results demonstrate the potential of steel slag as a soil amendment in enhancing crop yield and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in subtropical paddy fields in China, while posing no adverse short-term impacts on the concentrations of heavy metals in the soil or the rice grains. However, long-term implications of this management practice and the cost/benefit remain unknown, so further studies to assess the suitability at large scale are warranted. "

Given the historical trend of water use in agriculture and its correlation with urbanization, the change in agricultural water use due to urbanization is estimated. Then the impacts of this change on regional crop production are simulated based on the China Water Simulation Model (CWSM). Within CWSM, a positive mathematical programming (PMP) optimizes water allocation among crops and between irrigated and rainfed areas within a crop in each of ten river basins in China. The results show that water use in China has an obvious increasing trend, particularly in the industrial and domestic sectors, while the share of water use in agricultural sector has been dropping. A 1-percentage-point increase in urbanization can result in a 0.47 percentage-point decline in share of water use. Based on the model simulation, this will lead to the further decrease of irrigated areas and the increase of rainfed areas at both the national and river basin levels, particularly for water intensive crops (such as rice and wheat). Accordingly, average yields and total production will also decrease. A river basin with large production of either rice or wheat (or both) decreases more in irrigated area as urban area expands. Adaptation measures are recommended for both authorities and farmers to ensure food security, such as providing incentive for farmers to adopt water saving technology, implementing appropriate institutional and policy innovations (e.g., water use association, water pricing and water use rights).

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) reveals that this kind of spatial pattern has high correlation with the change of temperature from April to October (α = 0.01). The impacts of precipitation change are less than those of temperature change in the corresponding period. Most notable yield-increased regions sensitive to the temperature change in April to October are located at the climate transitional zones in China. The fluctuation of temperature, as well as that of precipitation, plays important roles in changes of grain yield per unit sown-area.

However, few studies have examined the drug resistance endowed by integrons and integron-associated gene cassettes in different phylogenetic groups of E. coli isolated from broiler carcasses. In this study, 373 antibiotic-resistant E. coli strains were isolated from the surfaces or insides of broiler carcasses from a slaughterhouse in Shandong Province, China. According to phylogenetic assays of chuA, yjaA, and an anonymous DNA fragment, TSPE4-C2, these isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D) and seven subgroups (A0, A1, B1, B21, B22, D1, and D2). Of the tested isolates, 95.71% (n=357) are multi-drug resistant, among which group B1 was predominant, accounting for 33.51% (n=125) of the tested isolates.

Agriculture accounts for approximately 11 % of China’s national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with cereal production representing a large proportion (about 32 %) of agricultural emissions. Minimizing emissions per unit of product is a policy objective and we estimated the GHG intensities (GHGI) of rice, wheat and maize production in China from 1985 to 2010. Results show significant variations of GHGIs among Chinese provinces and regions. Relative to wheat and maize, GHGI of rice production is much higher owing to CH4 emissions, and is more closely related to yield levels. In general, the south and central has been the most carbon intensive region in rice production while the GHGI of wheat production is highest in north and northwest provinces. The southwest has been characterized by the highest maize GHGI but the lowest rice GHGI. Compared to the baseline scenario, a 2 % annual reduction in N inputs, combined with improved water management in rice paddies, would mitigate 17 % of total GHG emissions from cereal production in 2020 while sustaining the required yield increase to ensure food security. Better management practices will entail additional gains in soil organic carbon further decreasing GHGI. To realize the full mitigation potential while maximizing agriculture development, the design of appropriate policies should accommodate local conditions. "

Therefore, analyzing the spatial and temporal characteristics of rice potential productivity and predicting the possible yield increment in main rice production regions of China is important for guiding rice production and ensuring food security. Using meteorological data of main rice production regions from 1961 to 1970 (the 1960s) and from 1996 to 2005 (the 2000s) provided by 333 stations, the potential photosynthetic, photo-thermal and climatic productivities in rice crop of the 1960s and 2000s in main rice production regions of China were predicted, and differences in the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics between two decades were analyzed. Additionally, the potential yield increment based on the high yield target and actual yield of rice in the 2000s were predicted. Compared with the 1960s, the potential photosynthetic productivity of the 2000s was seen to have decreased by 5.40%, with rates in northeastern and southwestern China found to be lower than those in central and southern China. The potential photo-thermal productivity was generally seen to decrease (2.56%) throughout main rice production regions, decreasing most in central and southern China. However, an increase was seen in northeastern and southwestern China. The potential climatic productivity was observed to be lower (7.44%) in the 2000s compared to the 1960s, but increased in parts of central and southern China. The potential yield increment from the actual yield to high yield target in the 2000s were no more than 6×103 kg ha-1 and ranged from 6×103 to 12×103 kg ha-1 in most of the single- and double-cropping rice growing regions, respectively. The yield increasing potential from the high yield target to the potential photo-thermal productivity in 2000s were less than 10×103 kg ha-1 and ranged from 10×103 to 30×103 kg ha-1 in most of the single- and double-cropping rice growing regions, respectively.

Then, the temporal and spatial patterns of maize yield potentials and yield gaps during 1980-2008 were presented and analyzed. The results showed that maize yields became stagnated at 32.4% of maize-growing areas during the period. In the major maize production regions, i.e., northeastern China, the North China Plain (NCP) and southwestern China, yield gap percentages were generally less than 40% and particularly less than 20% in some areas. By contrast, in northern and southern China, where actual yields were relatively lower, yield gap percentages were generally larger than 40%. The areas with yield gap percentages less than 20% and less than 40% accounted for 8.2% and 27.6% of maize-growing areas, respectively. During the period, yield potentials decreased in the NCP and southwestern China due to increase in temperature and decrease in solar radiation; by contrast, increased in northern, northeastern and southeastern China due to increases in both temperature and solar radiation. Yield gap percentages decreased generally by ~2% per year across the major maize production regions, although increased in some areas in northern and northeastern China. The shrinking of yield gap was due to increases in actual yields and decreases in yield potentials in the NCP and southwestern China; and due to larger increases in actual yields than in yield potentials in northeastern and southeastern China. The results highlight the importance of sustainable intensification of agriculture to close yield gaps, as well as breeding new cultivars to increase yield potentials, to meet the increasing food demand.

Soil erosion is a significant environmental problem facing the region, affecting both productivity of the land and water quality. The challenge for the region is to secure year-round food production in such a fragile environment. More than 90% of rain falls in a distinct wet season between November and April. Therefore, cropping in this region is dependent on matching crop growth with water supply. In particular, crop production depends on the efficient use of rainfall during the wet season, including avoidance of waterlogging, and efficient use of stored soil water during the dry season. This paper summarises the results of a series of experiments undertaken in West Timor, Indonesia, between 1993 and 1999 aimed at developing a raised-bed cropping system. The objective of these studies was to better utilise the more fertile alluvial soils that are often susceptible to waterlogging during the wet season, allowing a range of crops to be grown in addition to rice. Raised beds of height 0.2 m and width 1.5 m were constructed either manually or with an 8.5 hp two-wheeled hand tractor. A range of crops including soybeans, sorghum, maize, pigeon pea, yam bean and cassava were successfully grown on raised beds in the wet season in addition to rice, indicating that raised-bed technology overcomes the constraints of waterlogging in the wet season. Soybeans grew particularly well on raised beds, with December-sown crops producing almost twice the yield of January-sown crops (2.6 v. 1.4 t/ha). For rice and soybeans, early sown crops were better able to match growth with water supply, thereby avoiding end-of-season drought. Early sowing and harvesting of wet season crops enables a drought-resistant crop such as sorghum to be planted in late March or early April, utilising the stored soil moisture for grain production and also maintaining ground cover in the dry season. It is argued that cropping systems based on permanent raised beds can reduce erosion in 2 ways. First, raised beds are a permanent structure and, with the inter-cropping and relay-cropping proposed, crops can provide all-year ground cover in lowland areas. Second, if sufficient food and cash crops are grown on raised beds to meet the basic needs of subsistence farmers, then upland cropping on steep slopes can be replaced by a variety of tree species, providing additional food, fodder, firewood and medicines. Together, these strategies have the capacity to enhance food production and security in the semi-arid areas of eastern Indonesia"

Unlike CPO, Reutealis Trisperma does not threat the food security because it is a non-edible plant. It can be cultivated on wide variety of land and has high potency as biodiesel feedstock. The research purposes to assess and to utilize the Reutealis Trisperma production as biodiesel feedstock for Indonesia by constructing a system model for the biodiesel production with related variables such as land, productivity, conversion efficiency, biodiesel demand and others, using Dynamic System Modeling. It also illustrates the projection of biodiesel production from Reutealis Trisperma and CPO. The scenario of pilot project of Reutealis Trisperma, which will be planted in several districts in West Java, and it will give the projection from 5-25 years of cultivation, starting from 2017. The result shows that Reutealis Trisperma and CPO will produce biodiesel sufficiently fulfilling the demand. Furthermore, in the year of 2028 as Reutealis Trisperma productivity increases, biodiesel demand will be fully supplied by biodiesel from Reutealis Trisperma. "

Thus, this study has used remote sensing data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and the Global Land Data Assimilation Systems to assess the aggregate change in groundwater storage across the Loess area over a period of 13 years, from 2002 to 2014. The results demonstrate that the total groundwater depletion occurred at the rate of 529.73 km3 yr−1, and the mean groundwater consumption rate was −3.89 cm yr−1 between the winter and monsoon seasons during the period of 2002–2014. The most extreme consumption rate occurred during 2004 (−7.60 cm yr−1), while the minimum occurred during 2003 (1.13 cm yr−1). Groundwater consumption at such high rates will prompt unsustainable groundwater levels, bringing about financial anxiety, vulnerability to environmental change and excruciating burdens to sustenance and water security. Careful assessment of spatiotemporal groundwater storage in the Loess area will help China’s water resource managers and policymakers administrate groundwater resources in the future to improve water and food security.

Understanding spatio-temporal distributions of meteorological drought is fundamental for drought disaster prevention and management, food security, and ecological balance. A standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), derived from the difference between the precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, was used to quantify drought events and consequently reveal the spatio-temporal variation of drought across Northeast China. SPEI at four lags (1, 3, 6, 12 months) was calculated from daily records of mean temperature, daily precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshine duration. These climate variables were measured at 90 meteorological stations in Northeast China during 1961-2014. Based on the monthly SPEI values (SPEI01) of each climate station, drought events and disaster were investigated and grouped. Temporal variations of drought events in moderate, severe, and extreme grades were investigated by annual occurrence times, seasonal occurrence ranges, and intensities. Spatial characteristics of meteorological drought in each class were quantified by frequencies of drought events, duration times, and intensities of drought disasters. To analyze the effects of time scale on the drought spatial distribution, the principal modes of variability of the SPEI at four time scales were identified using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method. Our results indicated that both interannual and seasonal droughts showed obvious variations across the study area during the period. Interannual drought fluctuated, called “dry-wet-dry-wet” from 1961 to 2014, and was associated with three turning year points of 1983, 1995, and 2008. Seasonal drought appeared more intensive and widely distributed in summer, whereas it was weaker with a smaller distribution range in winter. Drought frequency ranged from 15.2% to 19.2% over the study area. The average drought frequency for moderate, severe, and extreme drought grades was 10.61, 5.2, and 1.2%, respectively. The duration of continuous drought disaster ranged from 2 to 9 months, and the intensity of drought disaster ranged from -8. 8 to -3. 7. Spatial heterogeneity and complexity of drought were observed in Northeast China. The western region was the most seriously affected area, with the highest drought frequency. The EOF results showed that there were three main spatial modes for drought in Northeast China. The explained variance of the three leading EOFs ranged between 57 and 58. 9% as the time scale for calculating the SPEI increased from 1 to 12 months. The explained variance of EOF1 ranged between 37. 4 and 39. 4%, and the explained variance of EOF2 and EOF3 ranged between 10. 6 and 13. 1%, and 6. 5 and 8. 8%, respectively. The spatial coefficients of the EOF1 for all SPEI time scales showed a similar pattern, with spatially uniform variation over Northeast China. Based on the spatial distribution of the spatial coefficients of EOF2 at all SPEI time scales, we identified two homogenous regions: the southern and northern halves of Northeast China. Eastern and western parts of Northeast China were delimited by the spatial coefficients of EOF3. The spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation was more obvious as the time scale increased from 1 to 12 months. The results of this study provided valuable insights for early drought prediction and establishing ecosystem disaster management systems in Northeast China. "

A case study of 16 villages, lying in all the eight districts of Mizoram, was conducted in 2014 and 1527 households (76%) out of total 2010 households were surveyed through purposive random sampling method. Structured questionnaire was constructed and questions on three food security components and 13 indicators were asked. We used Z score technique to calculate data and finally got a composite score of all the components of food security. Our result shows that food availability in the study villages is very less as composite score stands for 0.003 whereas food accessibility is comparatively higher, mainly due to availability of fair price shops (mean value is one), high agricultural working population (40.1%) and high literacy rate (70.6%). Therefore, its composite score is 0.236. Food stability scores only -0.062 and finally overall food security stands for 0.178, which is inadequate.

In order to boost agricultural productivity, a change in price policy is needed to ensure incentive prices. This could be done by setting agricultural commodity prices at par with corresponding import and export parity prices. A higher investment in research and development can hardly be overemphasised.

The trade of 'virtual water' through agricultural products and its appropriation through foreign direct investment (FDI) in food production have emerged as potential strategies for water-scarce countries seeking food security. In Saudi Arabia, where domestic agricultural enterprise remains a state priority despite extreme water scarcity, a shift to overseas food production to meet domestic demand could have significant implications for water and energy use as well as local labor markets. This study evaluates the growing internationalization of food production in water-scarce countries using the case of Saudi Arabia as a microcosm to illustrate the tradeoffs in resource consumption associated with crop selection and farming practices. This analysis indicates that the implications of different types of large-scale agribusiness must be more explicitly accounted for in government policy given the non-renewable nature of groundwater and energy. This work also quantifies the increase in the import of virtual water through conventional trade, which has significant potential to minimize groundwater pumping for food production in arid environments. A brief, complementary assessment of the growing role of FDI shows that further analysis is needed to ascertain the long-term resource impacts of direct investment in overseas enterprise and to minimize potentially negative impacts on water access and rural livelihoods in target nations. Active engagement of local communities and/or more holistic investment in infrastructure or improving agricultural productivity could also help avoid the potential for conflict and contribute towards long-term sustainability.

This study investigates how reef fish stocks are related to environmental, localised resource use and market proximity indicators across 51 sites in the Solomon Islands. Hard coral cover is the best indicator of total target fishery biomass, with cover of less than around 31% associated with significantly less biomass than sites with higher coral cover. Direct resource use indicators such as fish consumption and fish sale pressure were poor predictors of target fish biomass. Distance of the fishery resource from community, provincial sub-station, provincial capital and national capital are all significantly and positively correlated with biomass for four key fishery families: Acanthuridae (surgeonfish), Scaridae (parrotfish), Lethrinidae (emperor), Lutjanidae (snapper). Multiple spatial scale relationships are evident between market proximity indicators and Lutjanidae and Scaridae families. Thus, while pooled target fishery biomass is constrained by environment, analysis at fishery family resolution reveals the effects of anthropogenic impact through market proximity on constraining fishery biomass distribution in the Solomon Islands. This study highlights the need for reef fishery managers and conservation practitioners to focus attention on proximity of resources to markets to sustain the ecological health of reef dominated ecosystems.

Hence, an effective seed production plan not only needs to take into account the overall commercial value of crop varieties, but also their potential to perform satisfactorily in respective agro-climatic regions, both under optimum and sub optimum conditions. In the present scenario of changing and fluctuating climate, this means that the seed plan should meet the demand of improved varieties having high commercial value and also be prepared to fulfil the contingent demands in fluctuating/unfavourable weather conditions. In India, drought and flood are of common occurrence in some part of the country or other. In the recent years, the rise in temperatures, particularly at flowering and grain filling stages, have also been experienced frequently. Intensive cropping schedules, growing industrialisation and poor soil management practices are affecting the soil status. Focussed and extensive crop improvement programmes, particularly in the post-New Seed Policy, 1988 period, resulted in a greater choice to the farmers with respect to new varieties and hybrids' availability. This, on one hand increased the profitability of the farmers, and on the other hand, also helped in increasing the Seed Replacement Rate (SRR), which is still much lower than the desired levels in different crops. The SRR has shown significant rise in the crops where suitable hybrids have been introduced, but in OPVs, specially in high volume, low profit crops, which are crucial for national food security, viz., cereals and pulses, more is desired. The seed production programmes must, at all times, ensure availability of seeds of such varieties, which can be taken up in the event of uncertain weather/constraints. For instance, when a timely sown crop fails due to early moisture stress situation, the farmer may go for resowing with a late sown, short duration variety or if the crop fails due to unfavourable weather in one season, the farmer may go for a substitute second crop, provided seeds of suitable varieties are available and the farmers are well informed and guided. The second aspect of seed production in the changing climate concerns the yield and quality of the seed produced under unfavourable weather conditions. Of various climatic factors, it has been observed that high temperature and moisture stress to the seed crop not only reduces the seed yield, but also affects the seed quality and performance of the resultant crop. In general, delayed maturity, caused by one or more environmental factors, reduces seed quality to a significant level. However, elevated CO 2 levels do not adversely affect the seed quality or yield. Given the assumption, that in post-PPV&FR regime the focus of the private sector would be to develop hybrids/varieties for favourable growing environments, developing varieties for unfavourable/uncertain environments and making available seeds of the same, following an advanced and timely planning will be the primary objectives of the public sector research and seed production organisations. To encourage this, a policy to provide certain incentives for the latter may be considered"

It is caused by anthropological activities and natural calamities. The immediate cause is the removal of most of the vegetation, which is followed by water loss and soil erosion, and is therefore, a major threat to biodiversity. Vegetation plays a major role in combating desertification. For vegetation development in a degraded land, establishment of windbreak and shelterbelt or greenbelt is necessary to control soil erosion. There are many perennial plant species used for the establishment of windbreak and shelterbelt globally. Utilization of multipurpose tree species in windbreak and shelterbelt will control soil erosion and enhance food security. Ziziphus spinachristi is one of the most potential multipurpose tree or shrub species highly adapted to arid climatic conditions. They play an important role in soil conservation through their strong root system and protect the topsoil from erosion. They can serve as a windbreak and provide highly nutritious fruits that bring income to the farmers. The leaves are used as fodder to animals and the flowers yield honey. In addition, extracts from fruits, seeds, leaves, roots, and barks are used in herbal medicine. Recently, four different species of Ziziphus were multiplied through tissue culture and experimented on desert rehabilitation in Kuwait.

More recently, the national government considered fishkills as a food security concern. Although recorded occurrences of fishkill show seasonality patterns, predicting with high fidelity when within seven days and where in the vast expanse of the lake will fishkill occur is still a challenge. A fishkill early warning system (FEWS) based on predictive models requires an expensive three-dimensional array of physico-chemical sensors that must not only span the lake surface but must also extend down within the fish culture depth. Currently, such a network of sensors is an impractical approach with a projected annual operational and maintenance cost greater than the amount it will save to avoid a fishkill losses in a year. In recent years, the social media has become one of the main avenues for expressing real-time concerns among technology-aware Filipinos. Because the social media has attained unprecedented reach even in the remote areas of the Philippines, it is seen as a possible cheaper alternative to sensor-dependent FEWS through what is called ""social sensors."" Social sensors are the ""tweeted"" concerns of lake residents when fishkill symptoms have been observed within the lake. In this study, an ICT-based system was constructed to collect dated and geolocated microposts from Twitter users within the 10-km radius of Taal Volcano (14°N, 121°E). The system collected tweets from February 2013 to January 2014 and computed the tweets' respective overall contextual sentiment polarities (OCSP). Two fishkill events were reported within this time period. Data show that neutral to positive OCSP prevail when no fishkills have been reported, while increasing frequency of negative OCSP's was observed 1-7 days before the reported fishkills. The co-occurrence of prevailing negative OCSP and fishkill event may provide the much sought-for fidelity to ""nowcast"" fishkill at a much cheaper price, or to augment existing physico-chemical-based predictive models. Such an ICT-based system may be customized to cheaply ""social sense"" other natural phenomena that threatens food security in the Asian region. The utility of this system to improve the nowcasting capability of FEWS underscore the emergence of a new remote sensing tool that can augment, if not replace, current conventional physico-chemical-based sensors"

Oil palm is one of the most important crops in the humid tropics, but smallholder growers (< 10 ha) typically have low yields, largely due to inadequate fertilizer inputs and/or incomplete harvesting. It is difficult to produce appropriate fertilizer recommendations for the smallholder growers, due to their large numbers and small farm sizes. In this work, we developed a way of transferring to smallholder growers the fertilizer recommendations that have been developed for nearby plantation fields using large fertilizer trials. The study site was in West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, and transfer of information was done using a geographic information system and maps of plantation fields, smallholder blocks, and soil types. The soil-map-unit descriptions were interpreted, and a unified classification system was derived. Then, fertilizer recommendations that had been made on a field-specific basis for the large plantations were allocated to soil types and thereby to individual smallholder blocks. In this way, block-specific fertilizer recommendations were made for more than 4000 individual smallholders. The procedures used were developed into a conceptual framework which is transferable to other regions. Recommendations can be updated as new information becomes available on smallholder block locations or plantation fertilizer recommendations. "

In the present study, a field experiment was conducted in China to evaluate the effects of integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM) on GWP and GHGI after accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions from all sources, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, agrochemical inputs and farm operations and sinks (i.e., soil organic carbon sequestration). The ISSM mainly consisted of different nitrogen (N) fertilization rates and split, manure, Zn and Na2SiO3 fertilization and planting density for the improvement of rice yield and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Four ISSM scenarios consisting of different chemical N rates relative to the local farmers' practice (FP) rate were carried out, namely, ISSM-N1 (25 % reduction), ISSM-N2 (10 % reduction), ISSM-N3 (FP rate) and ISSM-N4 (25 % increase). The results showed that compared with the FP, the four ISSM scenarios significantly increased the rice yields by 10, 16, 28 and 41 % and the agronomic NUE by 75, 67, 35 and 40 %, respectively. In addition, compared with the FP, the ISSM-N1 and ISSM-N2 scenarios significantly reduced the GHGI by 14 and 18 %, respectively, despite similar GWPs. The ISSM-N3 and ISSM-N4 scenarios remarkably increased the GWP and GHGI by an average of 69 and 39 %, respectively. In conclusion, the ISSM strategies are promising for both food security and environmental protection, and the ISSM scenario of ISSM-N2 is the optimal strategy to realize high yields and high NUE together with low environmental impacts for this agricultural rice field.

In this study, we quantify yield benefits of mealybug biological control in Thailand’s cassava crop by using two different types of manipulative field trials: i.e., ‘physical exclusion’ cage trials and field-level ‘chemical exclusion’ assays. In cage trials with two popular cassava varieties, root yield and total dry matter (or ‘biological yield’) were a respective 4.0–4.2 times and 3.5–3.9 times higher in the presence of biological control. Extrapolating results from cage trials, biological control thus ensured an approximate yield gain of 5.3–10.0 T/ha for either variety. Under chemical exclusion trials, P. manihoti populations attained levels of 3266 ± 1021 cumulative mealybug-days (CMD) over a 10-month time period, and no longer impact yields. Moreover, under effective P. manihoti control, both root yield and biological yield increased with season-long CMD measures, and pest management interventions-including insecticide sprays-led to notable reductions in yield. This study is the first to show how biological control effectively downgrades the globally invasive P. manihoti to non-economic status and restores yields in Thailand’s cassava crop. Our work emphasizes the economic value of biological control, reveals how current P. manihoti populations do not necessarily cause yield penalties, and underlines the central importance of nature-based approaches in intensifying global agricultural production.

The preliminary finding from lead writer's ongoing PhD research in the far western region of Nepal and authoresses long experiences in the field of climate change and food security of the country shows that the prevailing institutional barriers cause them highly vulnerable from the risks to secure their food need. This paper claims that both formal and informal economic, social and political institutional hurdles are the major reasons of reducing their capability which increase their vulnerability and limit the adaptive capacity to secure food in climate change variability and extreme events contexts. These institutional impediments in the contexts of Nepal, mostly, include the institutions of land tenure, market, caste and gender based occupation, wage labour, patron-client relations, schools and educations, settlement, untouchability and caste based discrimination, social networking, bargaining power, adaptation policies, and political engagement prevailing in rural area of the country. Therefore, the paper suggests that reformations of institutional barriers are essential for increasing the ability of such groups to resist impacts and adapt the negative impacts of the changes on production, access and consumption of food of marginal groups in sustainable away.

We hypothesize that the integrated system allows the increase of crop yields with improved water use efficiency, while reducing carbon emissions from farming. The hypothesis was tested in field experiments at Hexi Corridor (37°96'N, 102°64'E) in northwest China. We found that the integrated system increased soil moisture (mm) by 7.4% before sowing, 10.3% during the wheat-maize co-growth period, 8.3% after wheat harvest, and 9.2% after maize harvest, compared to the conventional sole cropping systems. The wheat/maize intercrops increased net primary production by 68% and net ecosystem production by 72%; and when combined with straw mulching on the soil surface, it decreased carbon emissions by 16%, compared to the monoculture maize without mulch. The wheat/maize intercrops used more water but increased grain yields by 142% over the monoculture wheat and by 23% over the monoculture maize, thus, enhancing water use efficiency by an average of 26%. We conclude that integrating strip intercropping, conservation tillage as well as straw mulching in one cropping system can significantly boost crop yields, improve the use efficiency of the limited water resources in arid areas, while, lowering the carbon emissions from farming. The integrated system may be considered in the development of strategies for alleviating food security issues currently experienced in the environment-damaged and water-shortage areas. "

TNMR is defined as percentage changes over time in yields and SOM contents in external nutrient input treatments relative to initial and control plots and represents the net effects of nutrient management strategies on yields and SOM contents. Organics + fertilizers significantly increased yields over three crops (wheat, maize and rice) on average by 29% relative to sole organics and 8% to fertilizer only. Higher TNMR values in yields were found with organics + fertilizers in the sequence wheat (53%) > maize (40%) > rice (8%). Significant and positive time trends in TNMR of organics + fertilizers in wheat and maize yield may imply enhanced sustainability of cropping systems. Addition of organics (alone or combined with fertilizers) increased SOM contents and their TNMR over fertilizers applied alone. However, benefits varied between organics and organics + fertilizers by land use type. The latter led to higher SOM contents than (for dry land) and similar to the former (for dry-flooded and flooded systems). 2.3 and 1.4 times higher TNMR of organics + fertilizers in SOM content in dry land than dry-flooded and flooded systems implies that dry land was more responsive in SOM content increase upon adoption of organics + fertilizers than the latter. Overall, despite variation in the quantitative magnitude in crop or land use type, compared with application of organics or fertilizers only, a combination of both represents the most effective way to produce more food, build up SOM and enhance sustainability, especially in dry land cropping systems.

Estimating the agricultural potential productivity and assessing its response to cultivated land changes could provide a scientific basis for strategic decision-making concerning grain production and thus guarantee food security. In the present study, the Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ) model was applied to estimate the agricultural potential productivity. Data from the second national land survey were first applied to characterize the changes of cultivated land (by comparing the cultivated land in 2009 with that in 2012) and their influence on potential productivity in Mainland China. We propose a utilization degree of total potential productivity (UTP) and its ratio coefficient (RUTP) to reveal the utilization status of potential productivity and its change characteristics at the provincial level. It was found that there was a trend for cultivated land to be shifted away from cities, and the average productive capability per hectare of cultivated land declined from 7386.5 kg/ha to 6955.2 kg/ha by occupying highly productive cultivated land generally near the cities and compensating less productive cultivated land in remote areas. UTPs and RUTPs indicate a significant difference in the utilization status of potential productivity among the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Grain production with the aim of sustainable development should be strategized according to the particular facts of each province. The methods we applied can mine the impacts of cultivated land changes on potential productivity and the utilization of potential productivity effectively. "

Prevalence estimates of ECC range between 50% and 100%. Most concerning are the severe cases of ECC that require treatment with restorative surgery under general anesthesia. These surgeries often displace children and families from their local communities to specialty hospitals for treatment; further, they are very costly to dental insurance payers such as the government. This study used community-based participatory research (CBPR) to explore oral health and hygiene practices in the Algonquin community of Rapid Lake, Quebec. A key goal of the study was to create a culturally adapted activity to promote children's oral health and hygiene practices. Methods: Focused ethnography was used to explore oral health beliefs and practices, and factors related to child oral health promotion with community members. Participants included children, parents, educators, healthcare workers, youth workers and elders. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants. Following, two focus group interviews were conducted: one with parents and one with school children. All data were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed iteratively using thematic analysis. Preliminary findings were then used to develop oral health promoting activities for children in the community. These activities were designed in collaboration with community workers. Results: Three main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) a gap existed between oral health knowledge and oral health behaviors; (2) challenges for oral health promotion included attitudes and beliefs, access, and priorities; and (3) parents needed to be further integrated into health promotion strategies. Key outcomes included: (1) the development of Eagles & Otters, a game designed to increase children's oral health knowledge; (2) an activity sheet to promote child oral health behaviors in the home; and (3) increased capacity in oral health promotion in local youth, community research partners and the student researcher. Conclusions: The findings of this study highlight the importance of both local and broader systemic interventions to promote children's oral health. At the local level, child oral health and hygiene was promoted through the development of activities designed to increase children's oral health knowledge and behaviors both at school and in the home where parents were directly implicated. Systemic level interventions are needed to address factors related to the social determinants of health, including cultural traditions, economic security, food security, and housing status. These factors contribute to overall health and enable the necessary conditions to promote and sustain oral health. "

Recreational fisheries are unique in that they are not subject to the typical drivers that influence commercial and artisanal fisheries (e.g., markets or food security). Nevertheless, although exposed to a different set of drivers (i.e., interest or relaxation), recreational fisheries can contribute to fishery declines. Recreational fisheries are also difficult to assess due to an absence of past monitoring and traditional fisheries data. Therefore, we utilized a nontraditional data source (a chronology of spearfishing publications) to document historical trends in recreational spearfishing in Australia between 1952 and 2009. We extracted data on reported fish captures, advertising, and spearfisher commentary and used regression models and ordination analyses to assess historical change. The proportion of coastal fish captures reported declined approximately 80%, whereas the proportion of coral reef and pelagic fish reports increased 1750% and 560%, respectively. Catch composition shifted markedly from coastal temperate or subtropical fishes during the 1950s to 1970s to coral reef and pelagic species in the 1990s to 2000s. Advertising data and commentary by spearfishers indicated that pelagic fish species became desired targets. The mean weight of trophy coral reef fishes also declined significantly over the study period (from approximately 30-8 kg). Recreational fishing presents a highly dynamic social-ecological interface and a challenge for management. Our results emphasize the need for regulatory agencies to work closely with recreational fishing bodies to observe fisher behavior, detect shifts in target species or fishing intensity, and adapt regulatory measures.

In this paper, we examine gender changes in agricultural labour allocations on Australian irrigated dairy farms impacted by climate-related reductions in water available for irrigation. In the Murray-Darling Basin area of Australia, long years of drought and the need to address ecological degradation have led to the introduction of water saving methods and these have had major impacts at the farm level. We present research indicating that a major outcome has been an increase in women's labour on- and off-farms. Yet, the lack of attention to gendered labour distribution continues the historical neglect of women's labour, maintains patriarchal relations in agriculture, significantly impacts women's views of themselves as agricultural outsiders, and reduces attention to a gendered analysis of climate change outcomes.

In this paper, we assess how adopting these types of assistance programs would change the food insecurity rate in Canada among households with children. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), we first evaluate the causal impact of these programs on food insecurity rates in the US using the Canadian definition of food security. Following other recent evaluations of food assistance programs, we use partial identification methods to address the selection problem that arises because the decision to take up the program is not random. We then combine these estimated impacts for the US with data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) to predict how SNAP and NSLP would impact food insecurity rates in Canada. Partial identification methods are used to address the “mixing problem” that arises if some eligible Canadian households would participate in SNAP and others would not. The strength of the conclusions depends on the strength of the identifying assumptions. Under the weakest assumptions, we cannot determine whether food insecurity rates would rise or fall. Under our strongest nonparametric assumptions, we find that food insecurity would fall by at least 16% if SNAP were implemented and 11% if NSLP were implemented. "

For each simulation scenario, the CAPRI model provides global and EU-wide impacts of climate change on agricultural markets. Results showed that climate change would considerably affect agrifood markets up to 2030. Nevertheless, market-driven adaptation strategies (production intensification, trade adjustments) would soften the impact of yield shocks on supply and demand.

Cooler temperatures (and increased sea ice) would be expected to have reduced both bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) habitats, forcing Neo-Inuit to refocus their hunting activities on landfast-ice-dwelling small seals (e.g., Pusa hispida) during winter months. However, an analysis of faunal remains from Foxe Basin's largest-known Neo-Inuit (Thule, historic and modern Inuit) archaeological site, Pingiqqalik (NgHd-1), reveals a long-term subsistence economy based largely on multi-seasonal walrus hunting. Two interrelated factors may explain these results: (1) a system of recurring polynyas provided a degree of ecological stability for local walrus populations, and (2) the development of a distinctive walrus caching regime-a form of which continues among the region's contemporary Inuit-allowed residents to adeptly exploit an ecological niche, thereby ensuring food security. Together, these factors likely insulated northern Foxe Basin Neo-Inuit from the worst effects of the LIA. "

Published data on projected wheat production is used to analyse how global production can be increased to match projected demand. The results show that the largest projected wheat demand increases are in areas most likely to suffer severe climate change impacts, but that global demand could be met if northern hemisphere producers exploit climate change benefits to increase production and narrow their yield gaps. Life cycle assessment of different climate change scenarios shows that in the case of one of the most important wheat producers (the UK) it may be possible to improve yields with an increase of only 0.6% in the emission intensity per unit of wheat produced in a 2. °C scenario. However, UK production would need to rise substantially, increasing total UK wheat production emissions by 26%. This demonstrates how national emission inventories and associated targets do not incentivise minimisation of global greenhouse gas emissions while meeting increased food demands, highlighting a triad of challenges: meeting the rising demand for food, adapting to climate change and reducing emissions.

After adjustment, mean hemoglobin A lc was 0.15% greater and mean concentration of C-reactive protein was 0.8 mg/L greater among participants with very low food security than among those with full food security. The adjusted mean concentration of cotinine among participants with very low food security was almost double that of participants with full food security (112.8 vs 62.0 ng/mL, P < .001). No significant associations between food security status and systolic blood pressure or concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed. Participants aged 30 to 59 years with very low food security were more likely to have a predicted 10- year cardiovascular disease risk greater than 20% than fully food secure participants (adjusted prevalence ratio, 2.38; 95% Cl, 1.31- 4 .31).

Federal law in the United States provides two major options under which health concerns about glyphosate use might be addressed. First, registrations of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) need to be cancelled if the costs are greater that its benefits. Since the cancellation of GBH registrations in the United States would lead to higher maize and soybean prices that would adversely affect food security, further analyses are needed. Second, US law requires consideration of the human dietary risk from pesticide residues, and tolerances of allowable amounts of glyphosate residues allowed to remain in or on food items have been established. Social cost curves depicting three options for regulating GBHs show preferred strategies dependent upon the magnitude of adverse effects on human health and food insecurity. Measures to reduce harm to humans can be identified to ameliorate health damages to allow some uses of GBHs to continue, but only if the evidence supports the conclusion that “no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.” "

Main Outcome Measures The contribution of foods and beverages to energy, nutrients, and diet quality by locations where food was obtained was compared across food security status. Analysis Descriptive analysis and logistic regression. Results Almost all US adults consumed food and beverages obtained from grocery stores, regardless of food security status (about 95%), which accounted for one half to two thirds of total macronutrient intakes. The diet quality of foods from grocery stores was better in highly food-secure adults. Convenience stores are used most by very low food-secure adults; those foods had the poorest diet quality profile. Dietary patterns of marginally food-secure adults more closely resembled sources and intakes of low and very low food-secure adults. Conclusions and Implications Food-insecure adults use food sources differently, resulting in diet quality differences of foods and beverages obtained.

In Norwegian historiography it has been a moot point whether this trade became economically important in a north European and Norwegian context during die ""commmercial revolution"" of the High Middle Ages (ca. 1100-1300), or during the next ""commercial revolution"" of the 16th century. In this article the English customs accounts from 1303 and later are used to argue that mis great expansion took place before the Black Death. The English customs accounts are combined with the Pfundzollbücher from Lübeck to argue mat the quantities handled in this trade were halved after the Black Deaüi because the population in me stockfish producing regions was also halved. The German Hanse did not initiate me export of stockfish, but Hanse merchants greatly expanded its volume between 1250 and 1320 and made its organisation more complex between 1250 and 1400. The Bergen Kontor as a political organisation has to be viewed in the context of its relationship to the Norwegian state. In the period 1282-1560 Hanse merchants insisted that all state legislation concerning mem had to be included in privileges accepted by the Kontor. Before and after this period no one contested the state's power to legislate on all foreign merchants during their stay in Bergen. In Bergen mere were roughly 1000 German ""winter residents"" who stayed in the town all year. During the Bergen fair (July-September) this number roughly doubled, ""summer guests"" and sailors included. All of them were armed. The Kontor militia commanded by the aldermen was able to take military control of the town if required. State power in Bergen was weak between 1319 and 1560 not only because of the Hanse but also because the Dano-Norwegian state gave a low priority to the situation in Bergen. The Kontor practiced exterritorial jurisdiction in cases where its own members were involved. The ""winter residents"" controlled the Kontor organisation and used it effectively against ""summer guests"" from Hanse towns, Norwegian domestic traders and competitors from England and Holland to defend their credit system. After ca. 1560 the Kontor was subjected to the control of a stronger state, but continued to exist until 1766. How did Norwegians react to the German presence? Domestic Norwegian merchants in Bergen and state officials there found it problematic. But new research shows that thousands of stockfish-producing households saw the trade as a source of economic welfare, and food security in case of local crop failures, in a region which, after all, was at the northern fringe of Europe.

Through this exploration, four main themes were identified; a positive and open space to contribute ideas, diversity and common ground, confidence and capacity, and uncertainty. Findings from this study suggest that the participatory advocacy project provided a positive and open space for stakeholders to contribute ideas, through which the group was able to narrow its focus and establish a goal for advocacy. The project also seems to have contributed to the group’s confidence and capacity to engage in advocacy by creating a space for learning and knowledge sharing, though stakeholders expressed uncertainty regarding some aspects of the project.

This paper reviews the present knowledge of recorded impacts of climate change and variability on crop production, in order to estimate its contribution to the current situation. Many studies demonstrate increased regional temperatures over the last 40 years (often through greater increases in minimum rather than maximum temperatures), but effects on crop yields are mixed. Distinguishing climate effects from changes in yield resulting from improved crop management and genotypes is difficult, but phenological changes affecting sowing, maturity and disease incidence are emerging. Anthropogenic factors appear to be a significant contributory factor to the observed decline in rainfall in southwestern and southeastern Australia, which reduced tradable wheat grain during 2007. Indirect effects of climate change through actions to mitigate or adapt to anticipated changes in climate are also evident. The amount of land diverted from crop production to biofuel production is small but has had a disproportionate effect on tradable grains from the USA. Adaptation of crop production practices and other components of the food system contributing to food security in response to variable and changing climates have occurred, but those households without adequate livelihoods are most in danger of becoming food insecure. Overall, we conclude that changing climate is a small contributor to the current food crisis but cannot be ignored. "

We conduct empirical analysis of observation data and numerical simulations for case studies in Nebraska, USA, to compare the impacts of changes in well yield and groundwater depth on agricultural production. Our findings suggest that declining well pumping capacities reduce irrigated production areas and profits significantly, whereas increased pumping costs reduce profits but have minimal impacts on the intensity of groundwater-fed irrigation.

This ethnographic study aimed to give voice to rural families about their experiences with food insecurity while situating the findings within the broader social, political and economic context. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women who had children living at home, and interviewer observations within the food bank were recorded as field notes. Content analysis was combined with the constant comparison method of data analysis to identify common themes regarding the experience of living with food insecurity and the influence of public policy. RESULTS: Seven female participants described the emotional toll that food insecurity had on their well-being and relationships, with stress and depression common to many women. Strategies used to stretch resources included cooking from scratch, growing produce, stocking up on sale items, hunting and fishing, and paying half-bills. Many participants described going without food so that their children could eat first, and three participants went without prescription medications. Rurality and social programs were identified as both supports and barriers to overcoming food insecurity. CONCLUSION: Participants in this study were highly skilled in attempting to feed their families with limited resources, although this proved inadequate to overcome their food insecurity. This highlights the need for policy initiatives to address the root causes of food insecurity and health inequities, including access to rural employment and high-quality child care, drug benefits and guaranteed annual income programs.

One of the persistent myths concerning food insecurity is that it is caused by a shortfall in food production. Quite to the contrary, there is plenty of food to go around. The reasons for food insecurity are complex, but one of the main factors is poverty. Biotechnology provides a range of tools that can be used to improve agriculture in the developing world. This book considers some of the biotechnology-based approaches to improving agriculture and food security in the developing world. Despite the wealth present in American society, high rates of food insecurity, food insufficiency, and hunger are a significant problem in the United States. Some adults have obsessive concerns about their food supply. A study in this book suggests that this may, in part, be a symptom of materialistic tendencies developed in childhood in response to an insufficient food supply. A further study presents the effect of reports of food hardships on the presence of chronic health conditions. This book continues with specific research in seafood and meat regarding the abundance of these products, food security concerns as well as health related issues. "

Four themes emerged from the interviews with children: sources of food; security of food, nutritional quality of food, and experiences of hunger. Children's descriptions of insufficient food being available indicate that parents are not always able to shield them from the impact of food insecurity.

We conducted focus groups with family members of low-income children who were initiating care in a paediatric obesity clinic. Food hiding emerged as a theme, and generated the motivation for this analysis. Methods Between April 2012 and December 2013, a total of 7 focus groups were conducted (4 food-insecure groups and 3 food-secure). Based on recruitment from 37 index patients, the focus groups were attended by a total of 47 participants. Participant responses about eating behaviours were evaluated using a combination of inductive codes derived from the data and deductive codes informed by criteria for diagnosis of disordered eating. Results While participants from food-secure and food-insecure households all had anecdotes about their children overeating, respondents in two of the food-insecure groups described episodes that resemble binge eating. The topic of hiding food emerged in the food-insecure groups, though was not endorsed in the food-secure groups despite probing. Night-time eating arose spontaneously in two of the food-insecure groups, but not in the food-secure groups. Conclusion This study highlights the presence of food hiding, binge eating, and night-time eating in food-insecure children with obesity. These factors would further compound their health burden, and the relationship between disordered eating and food insecurity in children with obesity warrants further study. "

A theoretical approach, model and statistical-based, was carried out to assess the climate-induced variability of rainfed maize yields and yield gaps in different regions in Central-Southern Brazil in both main growing seasons. A crop simulation model was used to estimate potential (Yp) and water-limited (Yw) yields through thirty crop seasons. Based on observed local farmers’ averages and simulated yields, yield gaps related to water deficit (WYg) and crop management (MYg) were determined for first (sowing starting in September) and second (sowing starting in January) typical maize growing seasons. Overall higher average values of Yp and Yw (15.3 and 13.1 t ha−1, respectively) were obtained in the first when compared to second growing season (10.3 and 9.2 t ha−1, respectively). Statistical approaches pointed to similar importance between water and temperature on local biophysical limits in the scenarios. Assessed regions showed greater gaps due to crop management, with absolute averages of 5.7 and 3.2 t ha−1 in the first and second growing seasons, than gaps due to water deficit, with 2.1 and 1.2 t ha−1 in the first and second growing seasons, respectively. Opportunities for increasing average yields by closing the gaps were found to be predominantly through crop management improvements, in higher and more variable absolute levels on first than on second growing season. However, this management must be aligned with local climate, since its variability can determine relatively large gaps, even at intensively managed cropping systems. This study was able to highlight the importance of combining management, climatic and regional characteristics to provide a full perspective on main constraints of maize production increases. "

Global warming in the range of moderately high temperatures (15–32 °C) is projected for temperate areas of southern Chile, which is a high potential environment for potato. The present study assessed the impact of moderately high temperatures on yield and physiological traits, during tuber bulking (TB) of two native Chilean varieties and three commercial varieties. Experiments were carried out under field conditions during two growing seasons. Three thermal regimes were applied: (i) ambient temperature (T0), and increased temperature (2.3–5.3 °C) for 20 days (ii) from the beginning to middle of TB (T1) and (iii) from the middle of TB until the beginning of leaf yellowing (T2). Effect of temperature on yield and physiological performance of genotypes were dependent on the timing of heat treatments. T1 increased tuber yield by 11–59%, but T2 did not modify tuber yield. Yield sensitivity was highly dependent on genotype. Harvest index was the most sensitive trait to increase temperature at T1, decreasing in the range of temperatures evaluated without reduction for tuber yield. Increased tuber yield at T1 was associated with higher intercepted radiation between flowering and 50% of leaf brownship, explained in part by elongation of this period and stomatal conductance of leaves.

This paper explores the factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St. Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and food and nutrition security objectives.

For this reason, they play a very important role in tropical regions’ food security. Several pathogens throughout the tropical areas of the world have become a threat for production, including “black sigatoka” (Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet) which is the most damaging disease for Musa plantations in Cuba. It is present in all areas of the country, and it replaced “sigatoka disease” (Mycosphaerella musicola) as the main threat. Chemical control and cultural practices reduce damages, but they are not solving the problem. Genetic variations are the basic tools to develop new cultivars with better traits, such as tolerance against various environmental stresses, resistance against pests and diseases, and improved yield and quality. Tissue culture techniques offer the opportunity for variation induction, handling of large plant populations using established selection methods, and rapidly cloning selected variants. All these strategies can increase the efficiency of mutagenic treatments and subsequent screening of mutant materials. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is also an excellent system for clonal propagation and mutation induction. The present chapter describes a protocol on how to use embryogenic cell suspensions (ECS) in plantain (Musa spp.) using both in vitro gamma irradiation and plant regeneration in order to achieve genetic improvement. The process involves a series of steps to properly select ECS for irradiation and the posttreatment handling for plant regeneration as well as mutant selection during acclimatization phase and under field conditions.

Remotely sensed thermal-infrared imagery collected by Landsat provides estimates of land-surface temperature that allow mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the spatial scales at which water is being used. This paper explores the utility of moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery in water resource management. General modeling techniques for using land-surface temperature in mapping the surface energy balance are described, including methods developed to safeguard ET estimates from expected errors in the remote sensing inputs. Examples are provided of how remotely sensed maps of ET derived from Landsat thermal imagery are being used operationally by water managers today: in monitoring water rights, negotiating interstate compacts, estimating water-use by invasive species, and in determining allocations for agriculture, urban use, and endangered species protection. Other applications include monitoring drought and food insecurity, and evaluation of large-scale land-surface and climate models. To better address user requirements for high-resolution, time-continuous ET data, novel techniques have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of Landsat thermal-band imagery and temporal resolution between Landsat overpasses by fusing information from other wavebands and satellites. Finally, a strategy for future modification to the Landsat program is suggested, improving our ability to track changes in water use due to changing climate and growing population. The long archive of global, moderate resolution TIR imagery collected by the Landsat series is unmatched by any other satellite program, and will continue to be an invaluable asset to better management of our earth's water resources.

Researchers are striving hard to develop resistance against water deficit in crop plants to ensure food security for the coming generations. This study was conducted to establish the role of fulvic acid (FA) application in improving the performance of hybrid maize (Zea mays L.) under drought. Maize plants were grown under normal conditions till tasselling and were then subjected to drought by cessation of water followed by foliar application of FA (1.5mgl-1). Drought stress disrupted the photosynthetic pigments and reduced the gas exchange leading to reduction in plant growth and productivity. Nonetheless, exogenous FA application substantially ameliorated the adversities of drought by sustaining the chlorophyll contents and gas exchange possibly by enhanced levels of antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)) activities and proline. These beneficial effects yielded in terms of plant growth and allometry, and grain yield. It is interesting to note that FA application also improved the crop performance under well-watered conditions. Hence, FA may be applied to improve the crop performance under drought and well-watered conditions. "

CSA has given rise to a lively debate in both the scientific community and civil society although it addresses the pressing need for an efficient strategy to manage agriculture and food systems facing climate change (CC). CSA formally targets the simultaneous fulfilment of three criteria: (i) CC mitigation, (ii) adaptation to CC and (iii) food security. Yet, the review of scientific literature on CSA displays a clear discrepancy between these three objectives, underlining the fact that CSA is regularly perceived as addressing only adaptation, and not mitigation and food security. On the other hand, research on agroecology (AE) reveals an extensive knowledge about food security and adaptation, often at scales which can be considered complementary to those of CSA. A better use by CSA of AE research results may help CSA focus on two currently overlooked dimensions, i.e. (i) mitigation and (ii) trade-offs and synergies between the three criteria. CSA does not have a specific blueprint for climate-smart practices and has rather a strong focus on policies, institutions and financing. Hence AE actually responds to the needs of CSA in terms of site-specificity and potential for adoption by farmers because it is strongly based on local practices. We argue that an eco- and socio-logical approach to CSA represents a sine qua non condition if CSA is to promote inclusive development and participate to collective efforts to manage agriculture and food systems under climate change.

Elite cultivars, landraces and wild relatives harbor useful genetic variation that needs to be more easily utilized in plant breeding. We review genome-wide approaches for assessing and identifying alleles associated with desirable agronomic traits in diverse germplasm pools of cereals and legumes. Major quantitative trait loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with desirable agronomic traits have been deployed to enhance crop productivity and resilience. These include alleles associated with variation conferring enhanced photoperiod and flowering traits. Genetic variants in the florigen pathway can provide both environmental flexibility and improved yields. SNPs associated with length of growing season and tolerance to abiotic stresses (precipitation, high temperature) are valuable resources for accelerating breeding for drought-prone environments. Both genomic selection and genome editing can also harness allelic diversity and increase productivity by improving multiple traits, including phenology, plant architecture, yield potential and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Discovering rare alleles and useful haplotypes also provides opportunities to enhance abiotic stress adaptation, while epigenetic variation has potential to enhance abiotic stress adaptation and productivity in crops. By reviewing current knowledge on specific traits and their genetic basis, we highlight recent developments in the understanding of crop functional diversity and identify potential candidate genes for future use. The storage and integration of genetic, genomic and phenotypic information will play an important role in ensuring broad and rapid application of novel genetic discoveries by the plant breeding community. Exploiting alleles for yield-related traits would allow improvement of selection efficiency and overall genetic gain of multigenic traits. An integrated approach involving multiple stakeholders specializing in management and utilization of genetic resources, crop breeding, molecular biology and genomics, agronomy, stress tolerance, and reproductive/seed biology will help to address the global challenge of ensuring food security in the face of growing resource demands and climate change induced stresses.

Methods: A pot experiment was conducted with arsenic amended irrigation water (0.0, 25.0, 50.0 and 75.0 mg/L As) to investigate the arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice. In order to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves, twenty Wistar albino rats were divided into four different groups. The control group (Group-I) was supplied with normal laboratory pellets while groups II, III, and IV received normal laboratory pellets supplemented with arsenic contaminated rice, C. olitorius leaf powder (4 %), arsenic contaminated rice plus C. olitorius leaf powder (4 %) respectively. Different haematological parameters and serum indices were analyzed to evaluate the protective effects of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic intoxication. To gather more supportive evidences of Corchorus olitorius potentiality against arsenic intoxication, histopathological analysis of liver, kidney, spleen and heart tissues was also performed. Results: From the pot experiment, we have found a significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase of arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice with the increase of arsenic concentrations in irrigation water and the trend of accumulation was found as root > straw > husk > grain. Another part of the experiment revealed that supplementation of C. olitorius leaves with arsenic contaminated rice significantly (p < 0.05) restored the altered haematological parameters and other serum indices towards the normal values. Arsenic deposition pattern on different organs and histological studies on the ultrastructural changes of liver, kidneys, spleen and heart also supported the protective roles of Corchorus olitorius leaves against arsenic contaminated rice induced toxicities. Conclusion: Arsenic accumulation in different parts of rice increased dose-dependently. Hence, for irrigation purpose arsenic contaminated water cannot be used. Furthermore, arsenic contaminated rice induced several toxicities in animal model, most of which could be minimized with the food supplementation of Corchorus olitorius leaves. Therefore, Corchorus olitorius can be used as a potential food supplement to the affected people of arsenic prone zone to ensure the food security. "

Managing them well is vital to human well-being as well as the maintenance of marine biodiversity and ocean-dependent economies. Carbon sequestration and storage is increasingly recognized as a valuable service provided by coastal vegetation. Carbon sequestered and stored by mangrove forests, tidal marshes, and seagrass meadows is known as ‘blue’ carbon. These habitats capture and store carbon within the plants themselves and in the sediment below them. When the habitats are destroyed, much of their carbon is released back to the atmosphere and ocean contributing to global climate change. Therefore, blue carbon ecosystem protection is becoming a greater priority in marine management and is an area of interest to scientists, policy makers, coastal communities, and the private sector including those that contribute to ecosystem degradation but also those that are looking to reduce their carbon footprint. A range of policy and management responses aim to reduce coastal ecosystem loss, including the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper explores how MPA design, location, and management could be used to protect and increase carbon sequestration and ensure integrity of carbon storage through conservation and restoration activities. While additional research is necessary to validate the proposed recommendations, this paper describes much needed first steps and highlights the potential for blue carbon finance mechanisms to provide sustainable funding for MPAs.

This gene pool, which has been accumulated for almost a century, represents a huge genetic diversity of tuber bearing species of the genus Solanum L., which has a great importance for basic and applied research in general, and for human food security. The genebanks of potato and other crops have three highly important tasks such as permanent replenishment of collection material, ensuring its preservation by various storage and maintaining methods, including seed and vegetative propagation, its all-round use in basic and applied research, as well as the improvement of the efficiency of agricultural production. Analysis of performance of the above tasks in genebanks and research institutes in most countries concerned with storage, study and use of potato germplasm, shows great results and achievements, both in terms of its biology and its improvement as a food crop. However, the above three ways to perform tasks still need to be improved in connection with progress made over past decades, in particular in the field of basic and applied sciences. In this paper, a brief analysis of the status of conservation, study and use of potato genetic resources and its wild relatives in the domestic and foreign breeding, as well as solutions of problems in these areas are provided. A great leap forward today is the use of molecular genetic methods for genotyping collection material in gene banks to identify and itemize collection samples, as well as for using this material in basic and applied research, including breeding programs. Coordination of efforts for the collection of wild species that are not in the collections or are represented by a small number of samples, as well as the exchange of material and information about it, will help expand genetic diversity in genebanks and knowledge of the biological features of the potato.

On the other hand, host plants have evolved several strategies to defend themselves against pathogen attack. The attacks and counter-attacks can be likened to an ""arms race"", between two nations at war. Pathogens evolved strategies (arms) which include exertion of mechanical forces and secretion of biochemical substances such as enzymes and growth regulators, to attack susceptible host plants. These strategies are facilitated by the inability of the host plants to recognize certain molecules, known as PAMPs (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns) from the pathogens. In a counter attack, host plants have developed receptors to recognize the presence of pathogens and PAMPs. This recognition activates PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), thereby making the hitherto host plants resistant. Pathogens have further evolved another set of ""arms"", known as secretion systems and effector genes, whose gene products suppress PTI, thus causing diseases. As the arms race continued, plants have evolved effector-triggered immunity (ETI) by developing intracellular resistance genes, thereby resulting to a hypersensitive reaction that follows the gene-for-gene concept. Presently, some pathogens have developed mechanisms for the suppression of ETI. In some plant-pathosystems, the plants are winning, while in others, the pathogens are winning. Phytopathological research should therefore be directed towards assisting susceptible plants to defeat phytopathogens, in order to ensure food security. "

The promise of using this technology to accelerate plant breeding is being realized with a vision of genomics-assisted breeding that will lead to rapid genetic gain for expensive and difficult traits. The reality is now that robust phenotypic data is an increasing limiting resource to complement the current wealth of genomic information. While genomics has been hailed as the discipline to fundamentally change the scope of plant breeding, a more symbiotic relationship is likely to emerge. In the context of developing and evaluating large populations needed for functional genomics, none excel in this area more than plant breeders. While genetic studies have long relied on dedicated, well-structured populations, the resources dedicated to these populations in the context of readily available, inexpensive genotyping is making this philosophy less tractable relative to directly focusing functional genomics on material in breeding programs. Through shifting effort for basic genomic studies from dedicated structured populations, to capturing the entire scope of genetic determinants in breeding lines, we can move towards not only furthering our understanding of functional genomics in plants, but also rapidly improving crops for increased food security, availability and nutrition.

In TPIA, the specific precipitation patterns in infected tissues of leaf petioles or stem cross sections, observed with each virus, allowed identification of the specific virus or mixed infections in a single multiplex assay. For detection of PVY in green tissues, DBIA was shown to be over 50 times more sensitive than ELISA. TPIA and ELISA from the tuber stem end or from eyes might be used for rapid detection of PVY and PVS in seed potato tubers without prior germination. PVS was evenly distributed in potato tuber tissue, while PVY was localized in the vascular tissue beneath the epidermis, with irregular distribution along the periphery of the potato tuber.

By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60% to 70%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, ~800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints.

The current scenario could worsen due to the alarming increase in world population, further compounded by adverse climatic conditions, such as increase in atmospheric temperature, unforeseen droughts and decreasing soil moisture, which will decrease crop yield even further. Furthermore, the projected increase in yields of C3 crops as a result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations is much less than anticipated. Thus, there is an urgent need to increase crop productivity beyond existing yield potentials to address the challenge of food security. One of the domains of plant biology that promises hope in overcoming this problem is study of C3 photosynthesis. In this review, we have examined the potential bottlenecks of C3 photosynthesis and the strategies undertaken to overcome them. The targets considered for possible intervention include RuBisCO, RuBisCO activase, Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle enzymes, CO2 and carbohydrate transport, and light reactions among many others. In addition, other areas which promise scope for improvement of C3 photosynthesis, such as mining natural genetic variations, mathematical modelling for identifying new targets, installing efficient carbon fixation and carbon concentrating mechanisms have been touched upon. Briefly, this review intends to shed light on the recent advances in enhancing C3 photosynthesis for crop improvement. "

Among these abiotic stresses, salt stress is a serious threat to put down crop production especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world. Therefore, some serious steps are required to stop or slow down the lethal effects of salinity for ensuring food security. Various strategies are adopted to tackle the deleterious impacts of salinity to crops including breeding techniques and genetic engineering, but these techniques have their level of significance and cannot satisfy the whole demand. However, some biological strategies are cost-effective, environment friendly, and easy to adopt/operate. In this scenario, the use of various microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, algae) to enhance salinity resilience in crops is encouraged due to their vital interactions with each other and crop plants. Bacteria are widely used to mitigate deleterious impacts of high salinity on crop plants because they possess various direct and indirect plant beneficial characteristics including exopolysaccharide and siderophore production, biofilm formation, phosphate solubilization, induced systemic resistance, and enhanced nutrient uptake, and they act as biocontrol agents to protect crop plants from many diseases by killing pathogens. This chapter focuses on the negative effects of high salinity on plants, bacterial survival in salt stress, and their mechanisms to mitigate salinity stress and the role of beneficial microbes to enhance crop tolerance against salinity stress.

Substance flow analysis (SFA) is often used to understand urban P cycling and to identify inefficiencies that may be improved on. However, SFAs typically do not examine the factors that drive observed P dynamics. Understanding the social, ecological, and technological context of P stocks and flows is necessary to link urban P management to existing urban priorities and to select local management options that minimize tradeoffs and maximize synergies across priorities. Here, we review P SFA studies in 18 cities, focusing on gaps in the knowledge required to implement P management solutions. We develop a framework to systemically explore the full suite of factors that drive P dynamics in urban systems. By using this framework, scientists and managers can build a better understanding of the drivers of P cycling and improve our ability to address unsustainable P use and waste. "

Plants exhibit stress tolerance, escape or avoidance via adaptation and acclimatization mechanisms. These mechanisms rely on a high degree of plasticity in their cellular metabolism, in which phytohormones play an important role. “STAY-GREEN” is a crucial trait for genetic improvement of several crops, which allows plants to keep their leaves on the active photosynthetic level under stress conditions. Understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms concomitant with “STAY-GREEN” trait or delayed leaf senescence, as well as those regulating photosynthetic capability of plants under heat stress, with a certain focus on the hormonal pathways, may be a key to break the plateau of productivity associated with adaptation to high temperature.

Although great progress has been made in crop improvement, so far most efforts have targeted above-ground traits. Roots are essential for plant adaptation and productivity, but are less studied due to the difficulty of observing them during the plant life cycle. Root system architecture (RSA), made up of structural features like root length, spread, number, and length of lateral roots, among others, exhibits great plasticity in response to environmental changes, and could be critical to developing crops with more efficient roots. Much of the research on root traits has thus far focused on the most common cereal crops and model plants. As cereal yields have reached their yield potential in some regions, understanding their root system may help overcome these plateaus. However, root and tuber crops (RTCs) such as potato, sweetpotato, cassava, and yam may hold more potential for providing food security in the future, and knowledge of their root system additionally focuses directly on the edible portion.

In addition, these bodies synergize and harmonize the ethical issues related to the release and use of GM products. The labeling of GM crops and their products are mandatory if the genetically modified organism (GMO) content exceeds the levels of a recommended threshold.

Therefore, traceability of the transgene and its protein expression in GM crops is an important issue that needs to be addressed on a priority basis. The advancement in the area of molecular biology has made available several bioanalytical options for the detection of GM crops based on DNA and protein markers. Since the insertion of a gene into the host genome may even cause copy number variation, this may be uncovered using real time PCR.

Diseases of crops are particular crippling in developing countries that are heavily dependent on agriculture for food security and income. Various techniques have been developed to reduce the negative impact of plant diseases and eliminate the associated parasites, but the success of these approaches strongly depends on population awareness and the degree of engagement with disease control and prevention programs. In this paper we derive and analyse a mathematical model of mosaic disease of Jatropha curcas, an important biofuel plant, with particular emphasis on the effects of interventions in the form of nutrients and insecticides, whose use depends on the level of population awareness. Two contributions to disease awareness are considered in the model: global awareness campaigns, and awareness from observing infected plants. All steady states of the model are found, and their stability is analysed in terms of system parameters. We identify parameter regions associated with eradication of disease, stable endemic infection, and periodic oscillations in the level of infection. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations that illustrate the behaviour of the model in different dynamical regimes. Implications of theoretical results for practical implementation of disease control are discussed. "

A Theoretical Analysis,{},"Aquaculture;Biological interactions;Consumer preferences;Fisheries;Food security,consumption behavior;fish culture;fishery;food security;preference behavior;theoretical study",{},"This article offers a theoretical analysis of the impact that the introduction of aquaculture has on wild fish stocks and consumer utility, taking into account three key components: (1) the dependence of aquaculture on reduction fisheries for the feeding of the farmed species; (2) biological interactions between the wild edible species-the predator-and the wild feed species-the prey; and (3) consumer preferences for wild and farmed fish. Fisheries are in open access, while the aquaculture sector is competitive. We show that when biological interactions are moderate, the introduction of aquaculture is beneficial in the long run: it improves consumer utility and alleviates the pressure on the edible fish stock. Results are deeply modified when biological interactions are strong: the stock of edible wild fish is reduced and the introduction of aquaculture may even cause a decrease in consumer utility. We then explore the consequences of improving aquaculture efficiency and the sensitivity of consumer preferences to the farmed fish characteristics, in the case where biological interactions are absent. Lastly, we analyze how our outcomes on the entry of aquaculture are affected when the wild edible fishery is optimally regulated, in combination with different assumptions on the regulation of the feed fishery. Results are again conditional on the intensity of biological interactions. "

The consequence is that the current transformation of cassava from subsistence to a commercial crop is hampered by a lack of concrete, reliable and site specific recommendations on most agronomic issues.

This study tracked changes in the policy environment over a four-year period in three countries, and examined the role of targeted nutrition and IYCF advocacy strategies by a global initiative. Methods: Qualitative methods, including key informant interviews, social network mapping, document and literature review, and event tracking, were used to gather data on nutrition and IYCF policies and programs, actor networks, and perceptions and salience of nutrition as an issue in 2010 and 2014 in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. Theoretical frameworks from the policy sciences were used to analyze policy change over time, and drivers of change, across countries. Results: The written policy environment improved to differing extents in each country. By 2014, the discourse in all three countries mirrored international priorities of stunting reduction and exclusive breastfeeding. Yet competing nutrition priorities such as acute malnutrition, food insecurity, and nutrition transitions remained in each context. Key actor groups in each country were government, civil society, development partners and the private sector. Infant formula companies, in particular, emerged as key players against enforcement of IYCF legislation. The role of a targeted IYCF advocacy and policy support initiative was well-recognized in supporting multiple facets of the policy environment in each country, ranging from alliances to legislation and implementation support. Despite progress, however, government commitment to funding, implementation, and enforcement is still emerging in each country, thus challenging the potential impact of new and improved policies. Conclusion: Targeted policy advocacy can catalyze change in national nutrition and IYCF policy environments, especially actor commitment, policy guidance, and legislation. Implementation constraints - financing, capacity and commitment of systems, and competing priorities and actors - are essential to address to sustain further progress. The lack of pressing political urgency for nutrition and IYCF, and the uncertain role of international networks in national policy spaces, has implications for the potential for change. "

The engagement of rural social movements and other Civil Society Organizations in the negotiation process is an unprecedented effort in influencing governments to establish guidelines to gain greater access to land resources at the global scale. The Guidelines aim to promote food security and sustainable development by improving secure access to land, fisheries and forests, especially for small food producers, and protecting the legitimate tenure rights of millions of people against forms of grabbing, concentration, commodification and privatization of land which are shaping agrarian systems. They have been elaborated on the basis of human rights and in respect of local communities rights. From a strictly legal point of view, the Guidelines are not mandatory and hence they are not a source of legally binding effects for every single State. They do not derive from a formal legislative proceeding, and they are the result of a consultation and negotiation process coming from the bottom. Every State and international organization is called on to guarantee the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Guidelines. The authors contend, with critical arguments, that the process of consultation and negotiation that led to the endorsement of the Guidelines is quite relevant - in the current context of the large-scale land acquisitions - and very significant because it involved civil society and social movements, giving rise to an innovative instrument of soft law.

Two key questions challenging governments were: how long would the high prices last and with what effects on food security and nutrition over the longer run? This paper considers the drivers of the crisis and explores if, unlike past shocks, the recent price increases reflect structural changes in food price formation that will have lasting global implications. New cross-commodity relationships allowed prices to spike, although there was no shortage of food at the global level nor indeed a significant downturn in recent yields. Yet recent record levels of farm production were also mirrored by growing numbers of people chronically undernourished and/or micronutrient deficient. The gap between supply and need was underpinned by growing urban demand, consumption of processed and higher-value foods (including meat), biofuel policy, and purchasing power erosion, but also by short-term market-distorting policies implemented by governments responding to perceived shortages of food. Thus, the impact of future food price crises will depend largely on what policymakers chose to do in response to the peaks and what they do not do during the troughs. Appropriate investments are urgently needed not just in smallholder developing country agriculture, but in effective food policies and targeted programming that can reverse the recent negative trends in nutrition and that support access globally to improved diet quality as well as food quantity.

Yet there is a lack of research and effective governance at global or national scales designed to ensure the future availability and accessibility of this global resource. The world’s main source of phosphorus, phosphate rock, is a finite resource that is becoming increasingly scarce, expensive and subject to geopolitical tensions as one country, Morocco, controls three-quarters of the world’s remaining high-grade reserves. Given the criticality of phosphorus and the vulnerability of the world’s food systems to phosphorus scarcity, there is a strong need to stimulate appropriate sustainable phosphorus practices and technologies, and simultaneously, to initiate effective international governance mechanisms, including policy/research coordination and accountability. Sustainability indicators are increasingly being used as tools to facilitate accountability, implementation, evaluation and communication for global sustainability challenges. This paper presents the first comprehensive set of phosphorus vulnerability and security indicators at global and national scales. Global indicators include: phosphate price, market concentration and supply risk, relative physical phosphorus scarcity and eutrophication potential. National indicators include: farmer phosphorus vulnerability, national phosphorus vulnerability, national phosphorus equity and soil phosphorus legacy. Monitoring and tracking such indicators at the national and global levels can ultimately provide evidence of key phosphorus vulnerabilities or ‘hotspots’ in the food system, support effective phosphorus governance to stimulate targeted and effective action, raise awareness of this food security challenge, and evaluate the effectiveness and performance of global or national sustainable phosphorus projects.

Targets for banana breeding can be divided into five different groups: productivity characters, abiotic stress resistance, biotic stress resistance, postharvest characters and those related to markets. Yield is a key characteristic selected by breeders and used by farmers, while biotic and abiotic stresses cause major yield losses and unstable production from year to year. Musa genomics has developed rapidly since 2000, with the Global Musa Genomics Consortium coordinating research on the genomics of banana, aiming to assure the sustainability of banana as a staple food crop by an integrated genetic and genomic understanding. In the 21st century, crop improvement has accelerated by the use of genetic maps and DNA markers to identify useful genes, combine desirable traits or resistance genes and accelerate selection, but the difficulty of working with the sterile, triploid banana crop means these approaches have not been used as extensively as in other crops. Now, knowledge of genomics and understanding of crop design allows superdomestication, involving interactions of breeders and genomic scientists to design the characteristics required from a banana cultivar and consider how to produce this ideal cultivar - how to find and evaluate the genes responsible for particular traits, and how to bring them together in a new cultivar. Superdomestication allows definition of a cultivar with a suite of ideal characters ranging from biotic and abiotic stress resistance, through yield, to post-harvest and nutritional quality - many being quantitative trait loci with changing patterns of expression depending on conditions.

While organizing mass claims programs is challenging, the real difficulty is deriving remedies that are realistic, effective, implementable and that fit the wide variety of circumstances that people, communities and nations find themselves. Although the temptation can be to simply transfer specific remedies from one country to another, in reality these can be difficult to implement with success in places with different cultures, histories, grievances, aspirations and ethnic, sectarian, religious and class divisions. This paper argues that what is more important is the 'structure' of remedy approaches and how these can be adapted to local and national realities. As well, the necessity of any mass claims program to navigate constraints involving inadequate compensation funds, a lack of alternative lands for reparation, a low-capacity administrative environment and a variable willingness to evict current occupants, means that such structures need to be flexible, permutable and adaptable. This review examines the restitution remedy structures that fit these requirements, and that have been successfully implemented in a variety of land and property mass claims programs. "

They threaten the lives of people and livestock and destroy land-use systems and agricultural production. This has heavy impacts on the livelihoods of affected people, their economic situation and food security. In developing countries, poor and marginalized people are often forced to settle and to cultivate land in hazard-prone areas due to population pressure and, accordingly, the effects of landslides on lives and assets can be disastrous. People and their land-use systems, on the other hand, can influence the occurrence of landslides. Besides the physical causes and triggers of landslides such as geological failures, erosion processes and heavy rainfall events, activities such as forest harvesting, road construction, mining, unsustainable agricultural practices and overgrazing have been found to have an impact on shallow landslides. Their influence on deep-rooted landslides is, however, minimal. Most of the current approaches in landslide risk reduction follow a mainly technical path and neglect the human factor. Integrated approaches that take into account people and all aspects of local livelihoods, including socio-economic issues, agriculture, pasture, forestry and hydrology are needed in order to address this complex problem. To organize spatially the different land-uses and promote the implementation of suitable practices, one ideal approach is watershed management. It allows addressing upstream-downstream linkages, such as landslides, and provides a framework for sound land use planning. Adapted landuse systems and adequate natural resource management can reduce the potential for landslides and, especially, mitigate the processes leading to increased landslide hazards, such as gully erosion. Experience shows that often the underlying causes of unsustainable land-use are social or economic and that sustainable land-use practices are not adopted because they are socially not acceptable and/or economically not viable. Diversification of livelihoods, vegetation cover types and crop species - the mixing of different land uses in general - increases the resilience of local farmers and may improve the way natural resources and corresponding livelihoods can be rehabilitated after landslide events. Further, the sustainable management of natural resources and the diversification of livelihoods increase people's food security and have positive effects on water resources. "

The Holt-Winters and dynamic linear models performed equally well, giving the most accurate predictions of wheat yield. However, dynamic linear models have two advantages over Holt-Winters models: they can be used to reconstruct past yield trends retrospectively and to analyze uncertainty. The results obtained with dynamic linear models indicated a stagnation of wheat yields in many countries, but the estimated rate of increase of wheat yield remained above 0.06 t ha-1 year-1 in several countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, and the estimated values were highly uncertain for several major wheat producing countries.

Therefore, preparation and adjustments in a range of fields are needed. Regarding farming, the role of animals is discussed, as well as the options for securing their future welfare. Different scenarios are possible. Three possible lines of changed praxis are described, and the paper explores what ethical rationales could underpin each scenario. According to the first scenario, increased efficiency in farming is recommended. This solution combines efficient breeds and the 'least polluting' species. In ethical reasoning this view would mainly have utilitarian support. In the second scenario, husbandry decreases but is restricted to species that could be used for food and in pharmaceutical industry, e.g. bioreactors. This scenario includes an ethical rationale related to 'complex usage' combined with utility. A third scenario would be to adopt an organic standard, optimizing or harmonizing animal numbers and species to the available land, while concentrating on vegetable and crop production.

We analyze mitigation associated with different productivity pathways using the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM. Our results confirm that yield increase could mitigate some agriculture-related emissions growth over the next decades. Closing yield gaps by 50% for crops and 25% for livestock by 2050 would decrease agriculture and land use change emissions by 8% overall, and by 12% per calorie produced. However, the outcome is sensitive to the technological path and which factor benefits from productivity gains: sustainable land intensification would increase GHG savings by one-third when compared with a fertilizer intensive pathway. Reaching higher yield through total factor productivity gains would be more efficient on the food supply side but halve emissions savings due to a strong rebound effect on the demand side. Improvement in the crop or livestock sector would have different implications: crop yield increase would bring the largest food provision benefits, whereas livestock productivity gains would allow the greatest reductions in GHG emission. Combining productivity increases in the two sectors appears to be the most efficient way to exploit mitigation and food security co-benefits. "

The contemporary humanitarian system has significant weaknesses with regard to data collection, analysis, and action at all stages of response to crises involving armed conflict or natural disaster. This paper argues that humanitarian actors can best determine and respond to vulnerabilities and needs if they use sex- and age-disaggregated data (SADD) and gender and generational analyses to help shape their assessments of crises-affected populations. Through case studies, the paper shows how gaps in information on sex and age limit the effectiveness of humanitarian response in all phases of a crisis. The case studies serve to show how proper collection, use, and analysis of SADD enable operational agencies to deliver assistance more effectively and efficiently. The evidence suggests that the employment of SADD and gender and generational analyses assists in saving lives and livelihoods in a crisis. "

Issues of present and future climate variability and change on agriculture and forestry in the arid and semi-arid tropics of the world were examined and discussion under each of these issues had been presented separately for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Several countries in tropical Asia have reported increasing surface temperature trends in recent decades. Although, there is no definite trend discernible in the long-term mean for precipitation for the tropical Asian region, many countries have shown a decreasing trend in rainfall in the past three decades. African rainfall has changed substantially over the last 60 yr and a number of theoretical, modelling and empirical analyses have suggested that noticeable changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, including floods may occur when there are only small changes in climate. Climate in Latin America is affected by the El Niño-southern oscillation (ENSO) phases and there is a close relationship between the increase and decrease of rainfall depending upon the warm or cold phases of the phenomenon. Over land regions of Asia, the projected area-averaged annual mean warming is likely to be 1.6 ± 0.2°C in the 2020s, 3.1 ± 0.3°C in the 2050s, and 4.6 ± 0.4°C in the 2080s and the models show high uncertainty in projections of future winter and summer precipitation. Future annual warming across Africa is projected to range from 0.2°C per decade to more than 0.5°C per decade, while future changes in mean seasonal rainfall in Africa are less well defined. In Latin America, projections indicate a slight increase in temperature and changes in precipitation. Impacts of climate variability and changes are discussed with suitable examples. Agricultural productivity in tropical Asia is sensitive not only to temperature increases, but also to changes in the nature and characteristics of monsoon. Simulations of the impacts of climate change using crop simulation models show that crop yield decreases due to climate change could have serious impacts on food security in tropical Asia. Climate change is likely to cause environmental and social stress in many of Asia's rangelands and drylands. In the arid and semi-arid tropics of Africa, which are already having difficulty coping with environmental stress, climate change resulting in increased frequencies of drought poses the greatest risk to agriculture. Impacts were described as those related to projected temperature increases, the possible consequences to water balance of the combination of enhanced temperatures and changes in precipitation and sensitivity of different crops/cropping systems to projected changes. In Latin America, agriculture and water resources are most affected through the impact of extreme temperatures (excessive heat, frost) and the changes in rainfall (droughts, flooding). Adaptation potential in the arid and semi-arid tropics of Asia, Africa and Latin America was described using suitable examples. It is emphasized that approaches need to be prescriptive and dynamic, rather than descriptive and static. "

HIV is most often imposed on conditions of food insecurity and consequent malnutrition, poor sanitation, and chronic exposure to a myriad of infectious (eg, malaria, tuberculosis, and diarrheal) and noncommunicable (eg, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular) diseases. Women and children continue to bear the greatest burden. Two essential tenets underpin our approach to HIV: 1) antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are essential to prolong lives and to halt the spread of HIV and AIDS and 2) food and sound nutrition are essential to human health. The challenge is to apply sound principles of clinical care and nutrition science to the safe and efficacious implementation of ARVs and for long-term care for people living with HIV and AIDS. The WHO has played a leading role in developing guidelines to support this goal with the generation of general recommendations regarding nutritional needs of people living with HIVand AIDS and specific guidelines for the nutritional care of HIV-infected infants and children (<14 y of age). These proceedings represent a summary of the work accomplished at a workshop sponsored by the NIH to review the existing evidence to support changes in the recommendations regarding nutrient requirements for people living with HIV and AIDS; to support development of new WHO guidelines for adolescents and adults, including for pregnant and lactating women; and to identify a research agenda to address outstanding knowledge gaps.

Study design Cross-sectional study of 96 female individuals 12-21 years old seen at an academic medical center. Participants completed an iron deficiency risk assessment questionnaire including the 4 Bright Futures Adolescent Previsit Questionnaire anemia questions, along with depression, attention, food insecurity, and daytime sleepiness screens. Multiple linear regression controlling for age, race, and hormonal contraception use compared the predictive ability of 2 models for adolescent iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <12 mcg/L) and anemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dL). Model 1, the Bright Futures questions, was compared with model 2, which included the 4 aforementioned screens and body mass index percentile. Results Among participants, 18% (17/96) had iron deficiency and 5% (5/96) had iron deficiency anemia. Model 1 (Bright Futures) poorly predicted ferritin and hemoglobin values (R2 = 0.03 and 0.08, respectively). Model 2 demonstrated similarly poor predictive ability (R2 = 0.05 and 0.06, respectively). Mean differences for depressive symptoms (0.3, 95% CI −0.2, 0.8), attention difficulty (−0.1, 95% CI −0.5, 0.4), food insecurity (0.04, 95% CI −0.5, 0.6), daytime sleepiness (0.1, 95% CI −0.1, 0.3), and body mass index percentile (−0.04, 95% CI −0.3, 0.2) were not significantly associated with ferritin in model 2.

We examine nutritional trends under this baseline to highlight countries that lag behind in attaining key dietary sufficiency targets. Methodology/approach - Using a global multimarket agricultural model, we disaggregate the key macronutrients within food commodities to understand how progress toward target dietary intake levels of nutrients compares across various regions. We look particularly at those regions whose populations fall into the bottom sixth of nutritional attainment (the Bottom Billion) and note their slow projected progress toward achieving dietary sufficiency in key macronutrients. Findings - Many countries falling into the Bottom Billion category of nutritional attainment are in Africa and Asia. Colombia is the only Latin American country that fell into this category. Most populations in the Bottom Billion are deficient in carbohydrate, protein, and fiber intake. Practical implications - Policies aimed at eliminating hunger and improving the nutritional status of populations must be aligned with evolving socioeconomic patterns and changes that shape food consumption and dietary patterns. This analysis evaluates regions of the world in greatest need of attaining sufficient dietary intake of important nutrients, and sets the stage for a deeper discussion of policy options for improving these regions' food security.

According to WHO, more than one billion people are suffering from malnutrition, due to the lack of food; and more are at risk due to the lack of food security. The health of more than two billion people is adversely affected by micronutrient deficiencies in their diet, aptly named ""hidden hunger"". Deficiencies in key micronutrients lead to serious health and development problems. The effects are dramatic: children's intellectual and physical development are retarded, their resistance to disease is destroyed by the damage to their immune system. In adults it leads to reduced work capacity, reduced immunity, and huge loss of life in maternal and infant death. This leads to adverse economic effects, contributing to, if not leading, the cycle of poverty and disease. As micronutrients are required in minute quantities, it is now realized that providing micronutrients through food fortification is by far the most cost effective means to improving the health and economic status of the poorest people on the planet. While food fortification seems simple, and has been effectively applied in numerous programs around the world, wide-reaching food fortification targeted at large populations at risk of micronutrient deficiency diseases, presents numerous challenges. The technological challenges include understanding the stability and chemical interactions of food components and fortificants, as well as the engineering challenges of stabilizing and incorporating the micronutrients in food in forms that do not degrade the organoleptic properties of food. Beyond the technological challenges, programs have to successfully deal with a broad range of socio-economic, cultural, political and logistic factors. In this chapter double fortification of salt with iodine and iron is used to showcase the most recent progress made by a team of international, interdisciplinary collaborators in addressing the technical challenges of food vehicle selection, micronutrient incorporation into the food, confounding health, cultural, political and economic problems, and novel approaches to overcoming these. The purpose of this case study is to highlight the challenges in developing, promoting, and maintaining successful fortification programs, and the role of food scientists, technologists, engineers, and human nutritionists in the multi-disciplinary, collaborative approach required for food fortification programs.

The aims were to: (i) develop a more cohesive and focused research programme across the system of Centers and programmes; (ii) avoid dispersion of effort; (iii) mobilize capacity across the system; (iv) enhance opportunities for cooperation and coordination; and (v) define the scope of priority research for better accountability. The new process was based on discussion and emerging consensus, rather than quantitative evaluation, with a multi-pronged approach of information gathering and analysis coupled with broad consultation with stakeholders. Priorities were developed through: (i) deductive approaches including analytical papers on new challenges and opportunities; (ii) historical approaches including review of the current and evolving research portfolios of CGIAR Center and other selected research institutions; and (iii) inductive approaches-identifying the demand for new research by stakeholders, and of opportunities for the potential supply of research determined by expert scientists. Three criteria were provided to guide the final discussions: (i) expected impact of the research on the major CGIAR goals (poverty alleviation, food security and nutrition, and sustainable management of natural resources); (ii) production of international public goods; and (iii) alternative sources of supply and CGIAR comparative advantage to conduct the research. The establishment of the SPs has been very important in describing what the CGIAR intends to do at the 'System level', and for providing a frame within which further planning for research implementation and resource allocation can take place.

Our oceans-the largest underexplored component of the Earth system-are potentially home for a large number of new resources, which can directly impact upon food security and the wellbeing of humanity. However, the extraction of these resources has repercussions for biodiversity and the oceans ability to sequester green house gases and thereby climate. In the search for ""new resources"" to unlock the economic potential of the global oceans, recent observations have identified a large unexploited biomass of mesopelagic fish living in the deep ocean. This biomass has recently been estimated to be 10 billion metric tons, 10 times larger than previous estimates however the real biomass is still in question. If we are able to exploit this community at sustainable levels without impacting upon biodiversity and compromising the oceans' ability to sequester carbon, we can produce more food and potentially many new nutraceutical products. However, to meet the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations, we need to guarantee a sustainable exploitation of these resources. To do so requires a holistic assessment of the community and an understanding of the mechanisms controlling this biomass, its role in the preservation of biodiversity and its influence on climate as well as management tools able to weigh the costs and benefits of exploitation of this community.

The principal driver of such a drastic surge in energy demand is the increase in world population which was merely 1 billion in 1800, 1.6 billion in 1900, 6.0 billion in 2000, and is projected to be 7.5 billion in 2030 and 9.2 billion in 2050 before stabilizing at ≈10 billion by 2100. Heavy reliance on fossil-fuel consumption has increased atmospheric CO2 abundance from 280 ppm in 1750 to 383 ppm in 2008 and is increasing at ≈2 ppm (4.2 Pg) per year along with the attendant threat of climate disruption. Similar to the close link between energy use and atmospheric chemistry, there also exists a close link between food insecurity and climate change through degradation of soils and desertification of the ecosystems. Global annual per capita cereal consumption increased from 267 kg in 1950, peaked at 339 kg in 1985, and decreased to 303 kg by 2000. In the quest for identifying alternate sources of energy, world production of bioethanol (mostly from corn grains in USA and sugarcane in Brazil) was 65 billion L, and that of biodiesel was 13 million Mg (t) (55% in EU countries) in 2008. Conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, using crop residues or establishing energy plantations, has severe constraints of the additional requirements for land area, water, and plant nutrients. Removal of crop residues for energy and other uses has severe adverse impacts on soil quality and agronomic productivity. Yet, globally average crop yields must be increased by 60% to 120% between 2000 and 2050 for meeting the needs of increase in population and change in dietary habits. Meeting demands of the growing world population and rising aspirations necessitate serious and objective considerations of change in food habits (to a more vegan diet), improvement in energy-use efficiency, increase in crop yield per unit area and input, restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems, widespread adoption of recommended soil and crop practices, and identification of non-C fuel sources.

Vulnerable populations-children, the elderly, and the poor-will be disproportionately affected. Objective: We reviewed projected impacts of climate change on children's health, the pathways involved in these effects, and prevention strategies. Data sources: We assessed primary studies, review articles, and organizational reports. Data synthesis: Climate change is increasing the global burden of disease and in the year 2000 was responsible for > 150,000 deaths worldwide. Of this disease burden, 88% fell upon children. Documented health effects include changing ranges of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; increased diarrheal and respiratory disease; increased morbidity and mortality from extreme weather; changed exposures to toxic chemicals; worsened poverty; food and physical insecurity; and threats to human habitation. Heat-related health effects for which research is emerging include diminished school performance, increased rates of pregnancy complications, and renal effects. Stark variation in these outcomes is evident by geographic region and socioeconomic status, and these impacts will exacerbate health disparities. Prevention strategies to reduce health impacts of climate change include reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation through multiple public health interventions. Conclusions: Further quantification of the effects of climate change on children's health is needed globally and also at regional and local levels through enhanced monitoring of children's environmental health and by tracking selected indicators.

A 4-fold classification of emerging zoonoses was proposed: Type 1: from wild animals to humans (Hanta); Type 1 plus: from wild animals to humans with further human-to-human transmission (AIDS); Type 2: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans (Avian flu) and Type 2 plus: from wild animals to domestic animals to humans, with further human-to-human transmission (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS). The resulting holistic approach to emerging infections links microbiology, veterinary medicine, human medicine, ecology, public health and epidemiology. As emerging 'new' respiratory viruses are identified in many wild and domestic animals, issues of interspecies transmission have become of increasing concern. The development of safe and effective human and veterinary vaccines is a priority. For example, the spread of different influenza viruses has stimulated influenza vaccine development, just as the spread of Ebola and Marburg viruses has led to new approaches to filovirus vaccines. Interdisciplinary collaboration has become essential because of the convergence of human disease, animal disease and a common approach to biosecurity. High containment pathogens pose a significant threat to public health systems, as well as a major research challenge, because of limited experience in case management, lack of appropriate resources in affected areas and a limited number of animal research facilities in developed countries. Animal models that mimic certain diseases are key elements for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, as well as for the development and efficacy testing of therapeutics and vaccines. An updated veterinary curriculum is essential to empower future graduates to work in an international environment, applying international standards for disease surveillance, veterinary public health, food safety and animal welfare.

Our first contribution is to build a composite indicator that synthesizes the food indicators used by the Food and Agriculture Organization to measure the food availability and food utilization. Second, our empirical study is based on a model composed of a food security equation and an agricultural production equation. Our results show that sectoral FDI have different effects on food security. FDI in the agriculture sector improves food security and FDI in the secondary and tertiary sector increases the food insecurity. We found a significant FDI's spillover through the agricultural production to food security. While the effect is positive with FDI in secondary sector, it is negative for FDI in the tertiary sector.

Instead, based on our analysis, the dominant global IPR appears to have contributed to consolidation in the seed industry while failing to genuinely engage with the potential of alternatives to support social goods such as food security, adaptability, and resilience. The dominant IPR also constrains collaborative and cumulative plant breeding processes that are built upon the work of countless farmers past and present. Given the likely limits of current IPR, we propose that social goods in agriculture may be better supported by alternative approaches, warranting a rapid move away from the dominant single-dimensional focus on encouraging innovation through ensuring monopoly profits to IPP holders.

The phenomena of ""crop switching"" in relation to climate change can provide a useful solution to economic losses that may occur within the agriculture sector. Studies have assessed crop choice modelling and crop switching; however, most were conducted at the micro-level using farm data. This study proposed the use of crop data at a national level with a suite of climate change explanatory variables from the emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India. China, and South Africa -- BRICS) to assess crop switching. The variables were integrated into a logit panel for data analysis for the time period of 1980 to 2010. The BRICS were chosen specifically in this study as much of the population growth projected for 2050 are expected in the emerging economies. Furthermore, the BRICS already play an integral role in global agriculture trade and are the second largest exporter of crops worldwide. From the study, it was found that the relationship of crop switching to a climate change variable only occurred in Brazil and South Africa. In Brazil, the likelihood of carbon being emitted was 0.024 times lower if crop switching had occurred. This is probably owing to the growing biofuel industry in Brazil with 15% of the energy supply coming from sugar cane crops. In South Africa, the likelihood of carbon being emitted is higher if crop switching occurred. This could be the result of land distribution after the dissolution of the Apartheid regime where land was given back (albeit at a slow rate) to previously disadvantaged communities. A lack of farming knowledge transfer to new land owners could have resulted in poor farming practices and therefore, less carbon sequestration by crops. A major limitation of the study and the techniques used is the inability to investigate what crops have changed, if crop switching had occurred. While the microlevel detail of farming surveys is lost within a macro-scale study of this nature, the study does provide a useful starting point to delineate future data collection of other detailed analysis using remote sensing techniques and multinomial statistical models. Lastly, these techniques and methodology provide least developing countries (LDCs) with a costeffective solution to assess how crop switching has affected their agricultural sectors allowing them to adapt.

In April 1997, the CFS held its first discussions about the monitoring procedures and heard reports from countries that had begun development of national action plans. In 1997-98, a provisional reporting system will allow governments, UN agencies, and other international organizations to report on actions taken to implement the commitments contained in the WFS Plan of Action. In June 1998, the CFS considered a standard reporting format for the future. During 1997, all of the FAO technical committees discussed WFS follow-up, and follow-up will be included on the agendas of 1998 FAO regional conferences. All reports submitted to the CFS will be widely disseminated. Part of the WFS process will include further monitoring of the 1992 International Conference on Nutrition commitments. The CFS also encouraged the continued involvement of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and took measures to broaden NGO participation"
2-s2.0-85047743140,World,,{},Mushroom cultivation in the developing world: A comparison of cultivation technologies,{},"financial and food insecurity;low and middle-income settings;mushroom cultivation,Developing countries;Population statistics",{},"Food and financial insecurity are becoming prominent issues facing much of the developing world. As population densities in these already resource constrained regions continue to increase, it is inherent that a source of sustainable income and a reliable food source be provided, especially to rural populations. Mushroom cultivation is an environmentally benign, sustainable source of nourishment that is rapidly growing to become a profitable sector of agriculture. In high-resource settings, technological advancements have enabled farmers to maximize mushroom yields and quality while minimizing cost and input resources. However, these same benefits have not yet been realized in low- and middle-income settings and challenges characteristic to those contexts have hindered the development of mushroom cultivation. In order to better understand current efforts and their challenges, this article reviews cultivation technologies in both high- and low-resource settings. The outcomes of this review are then synthesized into a comparison of different cultivation technologies on the basis of cost, required resources, and overall success. Challenges and opportunities associated with mushroom cultivation in the developing world are also identified. For example, two prominent challenges in the developing world are spore production and post-harvest transportation and storage. Future practitioners, researchers, and entrepreneurs will be able to use this comparison to identify innovative ways in which the technological advancements of mushroom cultivation in high-resource settings can be applied to resource constrained environments.

2-s2.0-77955742954,World,,{},Education for rural people: What have we learned?,{},"Agriculture;Education for all;Education for rural people;Food security;Sustainable rural livelihoods,",{},"This article presents a synthesis of lessons learned since the launch of Education for Rural People (ERP) in 2002 under the leadership of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations as part of the implementation process for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The ERP program originated from the global consensus on the importance of education in reducing poverty and concern over the development challenges presented by approximately 880 million illiterate youth and adults and approximately 130 million out-of-school children, many of whom are rural and female. The most important products of ERP to date have been the knowledge generated and disseminated, innovations identified, and lessons learned by ERP partners related to policy and practice in areas such as education quality and access, gender responsive learning environments, parent and community engagement, and accommodation of non-traditional learners, to name just a few. Tools to strengthen national capacities to advance ERP have been developed. A global repository of the knowledge base on ERP has been established at FAO and is accessible worldwide via the Internet. Partnerships have been forged to expedite and facilitate implementation. ERP is now widely acknowledged as a top priority in the international education agenda. But educating all rural people is a huge challenge, and much is still to be done considering the number of out-of-school children living in rural areas. During this next phase, New investments will be needed at the national level. Preparing rural citizens to engage successfully in knowledge-based economies is central to the achievement of the MDGs"
2-s2.0-85051263351,World,,{},COP 21 and the global horticulturist: The way to climate smart horticulture,{},"Climate change;Food security;Sea levels,",{},"By the end of the century, changes in temperature and rainfall, rising sea levels and the likely increase in extreme weather events will have a considerable impact on horticulture. Globally, agriculture, deforestation and other land uses are responsible for about 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Faced with these changes, ensuring food security for all, especially for the poorest, is a major global challenge for horticulturists. Farmers from all around the globe will have to adapt to new contexts and this requires profound changes. The concept of climate-smart agriculture is based on the premise that it is possible to ensure production meets the needs of farmers while adapting to and mitigating climate change. CSA refers to agricultural systems that increase food security in the face of climate change, enhance adaptive capacity of farmers to the impacts of climate change, and mitigate climate change where possible. CSA has quickly been integrated into the global development agenda; it is not a new set of practices to be promoted to farmers, but rather an integrated approach to the implementation of agricultural development policies and programmes that strives to improve food security, livelihoods, and resilience under the realities of climate change, while at the same time capturing mitigation co-benefits where possible"
2-s2.0-33644872911,World,,{},Receptivity to social research by the CGIAR,,",",{},"This paper analyses the way the CGIAR system has incorporated social research in its agenda. Since 1995, the social science staff capacity in the CGIAR has decreased by 24 %, and the overall balance of social science research is still significantly tilted away from the core germplasm enhancement, production systems/natural resources management, and technology adoption work - the 'bread and butter' of technology generation and development effort - toward ex-ante and ex-post activities. Further, the bulk of the social science research has low social research content despite the significant expansion of the CGIAR initial goal of increasing the proverbial 'pile of rice' to poverty alleviation and sustainable food security. The paper concludes that a concerted effort is now required to mainstream social research in the CGIAR system, and this cannot occur without the full support of the CGIAR donors, the CGIAR senior managers, and the centre boards and executive staff.
